      <p>In addition, ATTENDANCE IN BOTH LECTURES AND RECITATION IS REQUIRED IN THIS COURSE. Some mechanism will be in effect for factoring in the attendance into the final grade. Students who miss a significant number of classes without obtaining excused absences from their instructors will find their grades penalized.  See below for more information on recitations.</p>

      <p>Homework
comes in two forms. One form consists of <a target="_blank"
 href="https://math.webwork.rochester.edu/webwork2/fall12mth143/">WebWork</a>
exercises. WebWork is an on-line homework system which provides instant feedback. When you have done a WebWork exercise correctly, your credit for the problem is immediately recorded in the database. You are encouraged to discuss
problems with other students. However, WebWork exercises are
individualized for each student, so you must do your own assignment.
There will be a WeBWork assignment posted for each topic covered.
Unless you hear otherwise from your instructor, WebWork assignments will be due on Monday at 6:59 p.m. You will
have approximately one week to complete each WebWork assignment, but it is your
responsibility to note when each assignment is due. (The due
dates will be included in the WebWork system.)</p>

<p> To access WebWork, click <a target="_blank"
 href="https://math.webwork.rochester.edu/webwork2/fall12mth143/">here</a>.   Your login name should be the same as your U of R e-mail user ID, (i.e. the
first part of your Rochester e-mail address), and your password should be your student ID number. You can change your
password after you log in. If you
cannot log in to WebWork, please email the following information to
your instructor, who will set up an account for you: (1) your full
name, your Rochester email address, and your student ID number, and (2)
the course number, your instructor's name, and the times the class meets
. Your instructor will set up the
account for you and contact you when it is activated.  Problem set 0 will give you an introduction to using WebWork.  If you experience any difficulty with WebWork, you should contact either your instructor or your TA immediately.</p>
      <p>The other form of homework consists of supplementary exercises
      that will posted on the website.  See the <a
 href="syllabus.html">course
schedule</a>
for the list of
problems assigned on each section.  </a> 
      These exercises do not contribute directly to your total
grade, but they will be discussed in recitation and similar exercises
will undoubtedly appear on exams. It is important to do
both the WebWork and the supplementary exercises. </p>

      <p>There
will be a weekly recitation where homework (WebWork and/or
supplementary exercises) will be discussed. See the <a
 href="syllabus.html">course
schedule</a>
for the list of
problems assigned on each section. Recitations start on 
September 10, and will be posted on near the elevators on the 2nd floor of Hylan on September 5 by no later than 5:00pm. Please sign up as soon as possible. </font></p>
<p> Once you are registered for a recitation, you will be expected to attend
that particular recitation.  If you miss a recitation, you are allowed to
attend another recitation.  However, you
must identify yourself to the TA whose recitation you are attending for that
week. If you wish to change recitations permanently, please notify
the TA in charge of recitations, Zhuang Hou, zhou@z.rochester.edu </span>.  Also cc both the TA of
your current recitation as well as the TA of the recitation that you hope
to switch into.  No switches will be allowed without going through this process.

      <p>It is essential not to fall behind because each lecture is
based on previous work. If you are having trouble with some material,
seek help in the following ways: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Ask your TA in recitation and go to their office hours or to those of another TA for the course. All TA office hours are open to
all Math 143 students (see the <a

course webpage</a> for a list of all TA office hours).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Go
to the Math Study Hall in Hylan 901 Monday-Friday 5-8 p.m.  Math graduate students are waiting to help you and answer your questions on a walk-in basis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Work with your classmates. This is always a good idea.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are having any difficulties, seek help immediately.  Do not wait until it is too late to recover from falling behind, or
failing to understand a concept.</p>
