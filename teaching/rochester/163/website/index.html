    <h3>Textbook</h3>
    <strong>Differential Equations: An Introduction to Modern Methods and Applications, 2nd Edition</strong>
    by James R. Brannon and William E. Boyce

    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    This course focuses on techniques of solving certain ordinary differential equations, which occur frequently in physics and engineering. We will cover most of Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 of the textbook, and possibly some extra material. That is, we will learn about first order differential equations and systems of such equations, second order linear equations, and stability.

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    MTH 143, MTH 162, or MTH 172


    <a name="Policies"></a>
    <center><h2>Course Policies</h2></center>

    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
    Students are expected to abide by the University of Rochester Academic Honesty Policy, available at
    <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty"><tt>www.rochester.edu/college/honesty</tt></a>.
    <br>Academic misconduct of any kind will result in the assignment of a failing
    grade.

    <h3> Class and Recitation Participation</h3>
    Students are expected to attend class regularly and to keep up with the assigned reading. Students are responsible for catching up with any missed lectures.
    <br>
    Recitations will meet once a week. These will focus on problems related to material covered in lecture and found in the homework.

    <h3>Course Communication</h3>
    All communication regarding course policies, material covered, and problems on homework, quizzes, and exams will be done through <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a>. Please post questions and comments there before resorting to e-mail or the WeBWorK "e-mail instructor" button. This way, students can benefit from each other's posts, and the same questions need not be answered multiple times.

    <h3>Homework</h3>
    There will be several <a href="https://math.webwork.rochester.edu/webwork2/fall13mth163"> WeBWorK</a> homework assignments, which will be due on Sundays at 11:59 PM. WeBWorK Set 0 is meant as an introduction to WeBWorK and will not count for a grade.
    <!--There will also be a few written homework assignments that will be announced in advance. No late homework will be accepted.-->
    <!--<p/>-->
    <!--In addition to graded homework, practice problems will be suggested from the textbook. These will not be graded, but similar problems may appear in recitations, quizzes, and exams.-->

    </table>

    <br>
    There will be two in-class midterm exams and one final exam.
    <br>
    These will be closed-book, closed-notes tests. The use of electronic devices will not be permitted during the exams. No make-up exams are anticipated.
    <br>


    <h3>Note to Students with Disabilities</h3>
    It is University of Rochester policy to provide reasonable accommodations to students who have a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, psychiatric, vision, hearing, or systemic) that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the College's Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning and their instructors for a confidential discussion of their individual need for academic accommodations. The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning is located in 107 Lattimore Hall. Staff can be reached by calling 585-275-9049 or through their website <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/cetl"> <tt>www.rochester.edu/college/cetl</tt></a>.
    <br>
    Please notify me of any need for accommodations as early as possible.

    <h3>Extra Help</h3>
    I will be available to answer any questions on a walk-in basis during my office hours. All questions regarding technical aspects of the course (solving certain ODEs, numerical simulations, etc) must be asked in person--email is a poor medium for discussing complicated mathematics. If you have other questions about the course that are non-technical in nature, of course please feel free to email. I may also be available by appointment. 

    <br>
    Math graduate students are available to answer questions on a walk-in basis in the Math Study Hall, which is open Monday through Friday 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM in the Math Lounge, Hylan 901.
