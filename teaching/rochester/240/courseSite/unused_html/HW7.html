#5: Let f(t)=ct+d with c > 0 then f((0,1))=(d,c+d). 
So we want d=a and c+d=b so look at f(t)=a+t(b-a).
Then f: (0,1) -> (a,b) is continuous and solving for f^{-1}(s) 
we get <br>
f^{-1}(s)=t such that f(t)=s <br>
f^{-1}(s)=t such that a+t(b-a)=s 
or t=s-a/(b-a)
thus f^{-1}(s)=(s-a)/(b-a) which is also continuous since b not equal to 
a. <br>
Thus f: (0,1) -> (a,b) with f(t)=a + t(b-a) is a homeomorphism. <br>
For b > a, the same f gives a homeomorphism 
f: [0,1] -> [a,b]. <br>

#8:(a) 
Let L subset Y x Y be defined as follows: L={(y_1,y_2) | y_1 <= y_2}.
Then consider F=(f,g): X -> Y x Y where F(x)=(f(x),g(x)). 
Note F is continuous since f,g: X -> Y are. (Thm 19.6) <br>
Also note F^{-1}(L)={x in X | f(x) <= g(x)} = A. <br> 
Thus to show A is closed in X, it is enough to show L is closed in Y x Y 
by Thm 18.1. <br>
To do this we show Y x Y - L is open in Y x Y. <br>
Take (a,b) in Y x Y - L then a > b in (Y,<) by definition of L.  <br>
We will find U, V nhds of a and b respectively in Y such that all 
elements in U are > all elements in V. Then we can use U x V as a nhd of 
(a,b) in Y x Y and this nhd will not intersect L. This will show 
(a,b) in U x V subset Y x Y - L and hence show Y x Y - L is open in Y x 
Y as desired. <br>
Recall a > b. Now there are two cases: <br>
Case I: If there is c such that a > c > b then we may use 
U = { y in Y | y > c } and V = { y in Y | y < c }, then clearly U > V 
and also a in U, b in V and U,V open in order topology. So we are done in 
this case. <br>
Case II: a is the immediate successor of b: <br>
Now we may use U = { y in Y | y > b} and V = {y in Y | y < a}.
Note U intersect V ={ y in Y | a > y > b} is empty. 
U,V are open in the order topology and u in U, v in V gives 
u > b (and hence u >= a since a > b and there is nothing between a and 
b) and v < a which gives v < a <= u so U > V here too. 
Thus we are done in this case also. <br>
(b) Let A = { x in X | f(x) <= g(x)} and B={x in X | g(x) <= f(x)}. <br>
Then clearly X = A union B and by part (a), both A and B are closed in X. 
<br>
Note h(x)=f(x) when x in A and g(x) when x in B. <br>
Also notice f(x)=g(x) on A intersect B. <br>
Thus by Thm. 18.3, h: X -> Y is continuous. <br>

<P>
#11: Given y_0, let i: X -> X x Y by i(x)=(x,y_0). Note given 
a basis set of X x Y, i.e., U x V, U open in X, V open in Y, we have 
i^{-1}(U x V)= U if y_0 in V and empty set if y_0 not in V. <br>
Either way, i^{-1}(U x V) is open in X. <br>
If W is a general open set, then W = union U_i x V_i where i goes over 
some index set. <br>
Then i^{-1}(W) = union i^{-1}(U_i x V_i) [Ex 2(b) page 20] <br>
So i^{-1}(W) is a union of open sets and hence open in X. <br>
Thus i: X -> X x Y is continuous. <br>
Note h(x)=F(x,y_0)=F(i(x)) and so h=F composed with i. <br>
Thus if F is continuous, by Thm 18.2(c), h will be continuous also. <br>
The proof that F cts -> k cts is similar. <br>
Thus if F: X x Y -> Z is continuous, h,k will be cts, i.e., F will be 
continuous in each variable separately. <br>

<P>
#12: [One of the purposes of this exercise is to show the converse of the 
previous exercise is not true.] <br>
(a) <br>
For fixed y=s not zero, <br>
F(x,s) = xs/(x^2+s^2) gives a continuous function F(-,s): R -> R. <br>
[Note s^2 > 0 stops denominator from ever being zero.] <br>
For fixed y=0, <br>
F(x,0)=0 for all x (note both cases of x still give zero) so 
F(-,0): R -> R is trivially continuous. <br>
For fixed x=s not zero, <br>
F(s,y) = sy/(s^2+y^2) gives a continuous function F(s,-): R -> R. <br>
For fixed x = 0, <br>
F(0,y) = 0 (note both cases of y still give zero) so 
F(0,-): R -> R is trivially continuous. <br>
Thus F is continuous in each variable separately. <br>
(b) g(x)=F(x,x)=1/2 if x not zero and 0 if x equals 0. <br>
Note g: R -> R is NOT continuous. <br>
(c) Let D: R -> R x R be D(x)=(x,x), note D is continuous. <br>
Now IF WE SUPPOSE F: R x R -> R were continuous then F composed D would be 
continuous 
too. However F(D(x))=F(x,x)=g(x) which we saw was NOT continuous in (b).
Thus our supposition was wrong and we conclude F: R x R -> R is NOT 
continuous. <br>

#6: X_j are sequences. We will use X_j=(X_j(1),X_j(2),.....) 
so X_j(k) will be the kth entry of the sequence X_j. <br>
We want to show X_j -> X in the product space (i.e. the sequence 
space), if and only if [for every fixed k, X_j(k) -> X(k).] <br>
Let us just do the case where the kth coordinates lie in the real numbers 
R for each k, to avoid confusion. Thus we concentrate on R^omega case. 
<br>
Pf: Breaks up into directions (A) and (B):<br>
(A): X_j -> X in (R^omega,product) implies [for every fixed k, X_j(k) -> 
X(k) in R]. <br>
Pf of (A): Let U be a nhd of X(k) in R. Then note 
R x R x ... x R x U x R x R x .... (U in kth spot) is a nhd of X in 
R^omega. Since X_j -> X in (R^omega,product) we have some N such 
that for j >= N, we have X_j in R x R x...x R x U x R x R x......
This means X_j(k) in U for j >= N and so we see X_j(k) -> X(k) indeed. 
QED for (A).<br>
(B): [For every fixed k, X_j(k) -> X(k) in R] implies [X_j -> X in 
(R^omega, product)]. <br>
Pf of (B): Let us look as a basis nhd of X in (R^omega, product). 
This is of the form W=U_1 x U_2 x ... x U_n x R x R x R x R........
Now X in W gives X(k) in U_k, U_k open in R, for 1 <= k <= n. <br>
For each k, 1 <= k <=n, since X_j(k) -> X(k) we can find N(k) 
such that j >= N(k) gives X_j(k) in U_k. <br>
If N=Max(N(1),...,N(n)) then for j >= N we have X_j(k) in U(k) 
for 1 <= k <= n and hence X_j in W. <br>
Thus indeed X_j -> X in (R^omega,product). QED for (B) and our thm. <br>

This theorem is not valid if we use the box topology instead. <br>
For example X_j(k)=1 if k=j, 0 if k not equal to j, give a 
family of sequences X_j. <br>
For fixed k, X_j(k) -> 0 as j -> infty. <br>
So X_j(k) -> O(k) where O=zero sequence. <br>
However X_j does not converge to O in (R^omega, box). [It would in the 
product topology by our previous work.] <br>
For example W=(-0.5,0.5) x (-0.5,0.5) x (-0.5,0.5) x...... is nhd of O in 
the box-topology but no X_j lies in W so X_j do not converge to O in this 
topology. <br>

<P>
#7: In (R^omega, box): <br>
closure(R^infty)=R^infty. <br>
To see this take X=(X(1),X(2),X(3),.....) not in R^infty, this means 
X(j) not zero, for j in J where |J|=infty. <br>
For j in J, since X(j) not zero, we can find U_j nhd of X(j) in R, 
which does not contain zero. <br> For j not in J, set U_j=R. 
Then W=product U_j is a open nhd of X in the box topology. <br>
Any sequence in W, has non zero entries in the jth coordinate, for j in J. 
Since |J|=infinite, no sequence in W can be in R^{infty}. 
This shows any X not in R^infty is in the exterior of R^infty (not in the 
closure). So closure(R^infty)=itself in the box topology as claimed. <br>

In (R^omega, product): <br>
closure(R^infty)=R^omega. So here R^infty is dense. <br>
Take any X in R^omega, X=(X(1),X(2),....). <br>
Let W be a nhd of X, then W contains a basis nhd of X of the form 
U_1 x U_2 x U_3 x ... x U_N x R x R x R ........<br>
Notice since this is a nhd of X, X(j) in U_j for 1 <= j <= N. <br>
Note Y=(X(1),X(2),...,X(N),0,0,0,0,0,...) is also in this nhd and hence in 
W. However Y also in R^infty so W intersect R^infty not empty. <br>
Thus for every X, any nhd of X, intersects R^infty and so 
closure(R^infty)=R^omega as claimed. <br>
