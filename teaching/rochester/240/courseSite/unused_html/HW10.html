#4: SUPPOSE X=U union V is a disconnection. Then U,V are nonempty open 
sets in the finite complement topology and so U=X-F and V=X-F' where 
F,F' are finite subsets of X. However if U,V is a disconnection, we also 
need U intersect V is empty. This is impossible since 
U intersect V = (X-F) int (X-F') = X-(F union F') [By De Morgan's law]
and X-(F union F') cannot be empty since F union F' is finite while X is 
infinite. Thus we arrive at a contradiction and hence we see there can be 
no disconnection (U,V) and hence X is connected.   

<P>
#6: A is a subset of X, C a connected subspace of X. We are given that C 
intersects both A and X-A. <br>
SUPPOSE that C does not intersect the boundary 
of A. <br>
Now in general we have a disjoint union <br>
X=(Int A) union (Bd A) union 
(Ext 
A). <br>
So if C does not intersect Bd(A), then we have <br>
C=(C intersect Int(A)) union (C intersect Ext(A)) <br>
Since Int(A), Ext(A) are in general open in X, we have 
(C intersect Int(A)) and (C intersect Ext(A)) are open in C. <br>
Now we are given that there is x in (C intersect A), since this 
x cannot be in Ext(A), we have x in (C intersect Int(A)). <br>
Also we are given y in (C intersect (X-A)), since this y cannot be in 
Int(A), we have y in (C intersect Ext(A)). <br>
Thus ( C intersect Int(A), C intersect Ext(A)) is a disconnection for C 
contradicting that C was connected. Thus we see that C must intersect 
Bd(A). <br>

#1:(a): Before starting, let us note that (0,1)-{a} is always disconnected 
if 0 < a < 1. This is because (0,1)-{a}=(0,a) union (a,1) and 
the sets (0,a) and (a,1) form a disconnection of (0,1)-{a}. <br>

Now if (0,1] were homeomorphic to (0,1) under homeomorphism 
f: (0,1] -> (0,1) then by removing the point 1 from the domain we would 
get a homeomorphism (0,1]-{1}=(0,1) -> (0,1)-{f(1)}. However this is 
impossible
since (0,1) is connected and (0,1)-{f(1)} is disconnected. <br> 
Thus we see (0,1] is not homeomorphic to (0,1). <br>
If [0,1] were homeomorphic to (0,1) under homeomorphism g, then 
[0,1]-{1}=[0,1) would be homeomorphic to (0,1)-{g(1)}. This is again 
impossible since [0,1) is connected while (0,1)-{g(1)} is not connected. 
<br>
If [0,1] were homeomorphic to (0,1] under homeomorphism h, then 
[0,1]-{0,1}=(0,1) would be homeomorphic to (0,1]-{h(0),h(1)}. 
This is impossible since (0,1) is connected but (0,1]-{h(0),h(1)} 
is disconnected. (Note since h is bijective, h(0) not equal to h(1) and 
it is easy to check removing two points from (0,1] always leaves a 
disconnected space.) <br>
Thus (0,1),(0,1] and [0,1] all have different homeomorphism types. <br>
(b): Note i: (0,1) -> [0,1], i(t)=t is an obvious embedding. (It is 
a homeomorphism onto its image.) <br>
Also j: [0,1] -> (0,1) given by j(t)=0.5t+0.2 
maps [0,1] homeomorphically to the subspace [0.2,0.7] of (0,1) 
and hence is an embedding of [0,1] into (0,1). <br>
Thus there are embeddings of [0,1] into (0,1) and (0,1) into [0,1] 
even though [0,1] is not homeomorphic to (0,1) by part (a). <br>
(c): Fix n > 1. If f: R -> R^n were a homeomorphism, then it would induce 
a homeomorphism from R-{0} to R^n - {f(0)}. However this is impossible 
since R-{0} is clearly disconnected while R^n-{f(0)} is path connected and 
hence connected. <br>
Thus there is no homeomorphism from R to R^n when n > 1. <br> 

<P>
#2: f: S^1 -> R a continuous map. Let g: S^1 -> R be defined by 
g(x)=f(x)-f(-x). [Note if x in S^1 so is -x so this makes sense.] <be>
Now g is continuous since f was. Furthermore <br>
g(-x)=f(-x)-f(-(-x))=f(-x)-f(x)=-[f(x)-f(-x)]=-g(x). <br>  
Thus if there is x such that g(x) > 0, then g(-x) < 0 and 
vice versa. Thus there are two cases: <br>
Case(1): g(x)=0 for all x in S^1, in which case f(x)=f(-x) for all x in 
S^1 and we are done! <br>
Case(2): There is x in S^1 such that g(x) > 0 and g(-x) < 0. <br>
However g: S^1 -> R is continuous and S^1 is connected so the intermediate 
value theorem guarantees a y in S^1 such that g(y)=0. For this y, 
we have f(y)=f(-y) [From definition of g] and so we are done here too. 
<br>

<P>
#3: f: [0,1] -> [0,1] cts. We want to show there is a x in [0,1] such 
that f(x)=x. If f(0)=0 or f(1)=1 then we can use x=0 or 1 respectively so 
we can assume f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1. <br>
Now define g: [0,1] -> R by g(x)=f(x)-x. Note g is continuous as f was and 
that g(0)=f(0)-0 > 0 and g(1)=f(1)-1 < 0. Thus by the fact that [0,1] is 
connected and the intermediate value theorem, we see there is x in [0,1] 
such that g(x)=0. Thus f(x)-x=0 or f(x)=x as desired. <br>

<P>
#9: Let A be a countable set and consider X=R^2-A. We want to show X is 
path connected so take b and c in X. <br>
Working in the plane, if L is the set of lines 
passing 
thru b then L is bijective to R union {infty} since we can correspond the 
lines bijectively with their slope (Note distinct lines have different 
slopes, and there is a line thru b of any given slope in R union 
{infty}).<br>
Thus there are uncountably many lines passing thru b. <br>
Let S be the subset of these lines which intersect the set A. Note 
we can make a map i: S -> A, which sends each of these lines to a choice 
of a point in 
A on that line. Notice i is injective since no point of A lies on more 
that one such line. Thus S is bijective to a subset of A and hence is 
countable. <br>
Thus only countably many of these lines will intersect the set A. Since 
there were uncountably many lines thru b, we conclude that 
there are uncountably many lines thru b, which do not intersect the set A. 
<br>
Choose one of these lines L_1. (Note if c happened to lie on L_1 then 
we could use L_1 as a path from b to c in X but we will assume that we 
are not so lucky and continue) <br>
Doing a similar analysis at the point c, we conclude that there are 
uncountably many lines thru c which do not intersect A. Out of these only 
1 is parrallel to L_1, so we can find L_2 a line thru c, which does not 
intersect A and which is NOT parallel to L_1. <br>
Thus L_1 and L_2 will meet at a point d. Then the line segment along L_1 
from b to d followed by the line segment along L_2 from d to c forms 
continuous path in X from b to c. <br>
Thus we have shown that any two points in X can be joined by a continuous 
path in X and so X is path connected. <br>
