<P>1:(a) x in A int B, then x not in A \ B and x in A so x in A \ (A \ B).
Thus A int B subset A \ (A \ B). <BR>
On the other hand, x in A \ (A \ B). Then x is in A but not in A \ B and 
so x in A int B. Thus A \ (A \ B) subset A int B also and so the two sets 
are equal. <BR> 
(b),(c): See old HW and definitions in book. <BR>

<P>2:<BR>
(a): See book for definitions. <BR>
(b): See old HW solution. <BR>
(c): Choose x(1) in A, then as A is infinite, A-{x(1)} is nonempty so 
we can choose x(2) in A-{x(1)},... , we continue in this manner choosing 
x(n) from A-{x(1),x(2),..,x(n-1)}. We know we can do this since A is 
infinite so A-{x(1),x(2),...,x(n-1)} is nonempty.
Then S={x(1),x(2),.....} is a subset of A and f: N -> S, f(n)=x(n) is 
clearly a bijection so S is countably infinite.

<P>3:<BR>
(a): See book for definitions. <BR>
(b): <BR>
|a+b| = |a| + |b| <-> (|a+b|)^2=(|a|+|b|)^2 [Since |x| nonnegative for all 
x]<BR>
<-> (|a+b|)^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 +2|a||b| <BR>
<->  (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2|a||b| [Since |x|^2=x^2 for all x.] <BR>
<->  a^2+ b^2 + 2ab = a^2 + b^2 + 2|a||b| <BR>
<->  ab = |ab| <BR>
<->  ab >= 0. <BR>
(c): Let s=sup{ a + f(x) | x in X} and t=sup{ f(x) | x in X}. <BR>
Then a + f(x) <= s for all x in X. So f(x) <= s-a for all x in X. 
So s-a is an upper bound for {f(x) | x in X} and so t <= s-a. 
Thus a+t <= s. <BR>
On the other hand, f(x) <= t for all x in X so a + f(x) <= a +t for all x.
So a+t is an upper bound for {a+f(x) | x in X} and so s <= a + t. <BR>
Thus we have seen a+t <= s <= a+t and so s=a+t as desired. 

<P>4:See old HW solutions. <BR>

<P>5:<BR>
(a),(b) See book/notes for definitions. <BR>
(c): Suppose Int(boundary(A)) is nonempty and take x from within it.
Then there is an open neighborhood U of x contained in boundary(A).
However since x is also in boundary(A), U must contain points of A and M-A 
by definition. Thus using U subset boundary(A) we see that boundary(A) 
contains points of A and points of M-A. In other words, there are some 
boundary points that are in A and some boundary points that aren't in A.
Thus A is neither open or closed by (b). <BR>
So we see Int(boundary(A)) nonempty -> A not closed and A not open. <BR>
We get our desired result by taking the contrapositive of this 
implication. <BR>
(d): If r in R, and E > 0 then in B(r;E)=(r-E,r+E) there lie both rational 
and irrational points. (Since every nonempty open interval contains a 
rational and an irrational.) Thus we see that r is a boundary point of Q.
So boundary(Q)=R. Since R is open in (R,d). Int(R)=R and so 
Int(Boundary(Q))=R.


<P>6: <BR>
(a)See book for definitions. <BR>
(b)See HW5 solutions. <BR>
(c): We work in an ambient metric space (M,d). 
Let K(m), m in J be an arbitrary collection of compact sets. (The 
index set J need not be a subset of the natural numbers, so can be 
uncountable too, let 1 in J though for notation purposes.) <BR>
Now compact sets are always closed, and the intersection of any collection 
of closed sets is closed so S = Int K(m) is a closed set. Let T=K(1) then 
T is compact by hypothesis. By (b), S = S int T is compact. Thus we are 
done.
