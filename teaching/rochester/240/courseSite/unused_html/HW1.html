<P>2G: We are given g(f(x))=x for all x in D(f). <br>
<B>R(f) subset D(g):</B> Since g(f(x))=x we see that g is defined on 
the set {f(x) | x in D(f)}=R(f). Thus R(f) subset D(g). <br>
<B> f is an injection: </B> Suppose we have x,y such that 
f(x)=f(y), since R(f) subset D(g) we may apply g to both sides of this 
last equality to get x=g(f(x))=g(f(y))=y. Thus f(x)=f(y) imples x=y and 
so f is injective. <br>
<B>D(f) subset R(g):</B> x in D(f), then x=g(f(x)) so x in R(g). Done.

<P>2E: <B>f^(-1) is a function:</B> If (b,a) and (b,a') in f^(-1) then 
this would mean (a,b) and (a',b) are in f. Since f is one-to-one, 
we conclude that a=a'. Thus we see that (b,a),(b,a') in f^(-1) imply a=a' 
and so f^(-1) is a function. <br>
<B>f^(-1) is an injection:</B> Suppose (b,a) and (b',a) are in f^(-1).
Then (a,b),(a,b') are in f. But f is a function so b=b'. Thus we see 
f^(-1) is an injection. 

<P>3F: Let S be an infinite set. Then there is a subset A which is 
denumerable and hence we can write A={x(1),....,x(n),...}. <br>
Now define f: S -> S by <br>
f(x)=x if x in S-A. <br>
f(x(n))=x(n+1) for x(n) in A. <br>
It is easy to check that R(f)=S-{x(1)} and that f is injective. <br>
Thus f gives a bijection between S and S-{x(1)} a proper subset of S.

<P>3I: I(n)={1,...,n}, I(0)=empty set. <br>
We prove I(m) does not have the same cardinality as I(n) if m < n, using 
induction on n. <br>
n=1 case. Here m has to be 0, and it is clear that I(0) is not bijective 
with I(1) since one is empty and the other has an element. <br>
So assume it is known for all values less than n, and <b>suppose</b> 
I(m) <-> I(n) for some m < n. (Here <-> means bijective correspondence.) 
<br>
Then we can write I(n)=I(n-1) U {n}. Let the correspondent of n in I(m) be 
called b, then the bijection restricts to a bijection 
g: I(m)-{b} -> I(n-1). <br>
However one can write down a bijection f: I(m-1) -> I(m)-{b} via
f(i)=i if i < b and f(i)=i+1 if i >= b. <br>
Composing f with g gives a bijection of I(n-1) with I(m-1) with m-1 < n-1 
contrary to the induction hypothesis. Thus the supposition in bold above 
was false, and so the induction goes thru and so we are done by 
the principle of mathematical induction.

<P>2.6 Note: To show two sets A,B equal, one can show that A subset B and 
B subset A, then it will follow that A=B because they have exactly the 
same elements. <br> [I will use U for union, Int for intersection] <br>
<BR>
Since A, B subset A U B, it is clear that f(A),f(B) subset f(A U B). <br>
Thus f(A) U f(B) subset f(A U B). <br>
On the other hand if y in f(A U B) then y=f(x) for x in A U B. 
Then either x in A, in which case y=f(x) is in f(A) or <br>
x in B, in which case y=f(x) is in f(B). <br>
In either case, y is in f(A) U f(B). Thus f(A U B) subset f(A) U f(B). 
<br> Since we already know the reverse inclusion, we conclude 
f(A U B) = f(A) U f(B). <br>
<br>
If y in f(A Int B), then y=f(x) where x in A Int B. <br>
Then x in A, so y=f(x) in f(A) and also x in B so y=f(x) in f(B). <br>
Thus y in f(A) Int f(B). Thus we see f(A Int B) subset f(A) Int f(B). <br>
<br>
Similar proofs work in the arbitrary union/intersection case.

<P>2.15
First we recall a fact from algebra that for any nonzero integer 
polynomial p, R(p)={x | p(x)=0} is a finite set. <br>

Let S be the set of all nonzero integer polynomials. <br>
We can write S as a union of S(n) where S(n) is the set of polynomials of 
degree exactly n. <br>
Since such a polynomial is of the form a(n)x^n 
+a(n-1)x^(n-1)+...+a(1)x^1+a(0), where the a(i) are integers, a(n) 
nonzero, we see that we can get a surjection <br> 
f: (Z-{0}) x Z x ... x Z -> S(n) given by  <br>
(a(n),a(n-1),...,a(0)) -> a(n)x^n +...+a(0). <br>

Since the domain of f is countable (we saw in class that finite Cartesian 
products of countable sets are countable.) and f is onto, we conclude 
that S(n) is countable. (Since images of countable sets are countable.) 
<br>

Then since S is the countable union of the countable sets S(n), we see 
that S is countable. (Can throw in the zero polynomial in S with no 
effect) <br>

Finally if A=Set of algebraic integers, then A is the union of the R(p) 
as p ranges over the countable set S-{zero polynomial}. <br>
Thus A is the countable union of finite (countable) sets and so is 
countable. <br>

<P>2.17 Suppose as suggested that f: R -> S is a bijection.
Then we will make a function as follows: <br>
h(x)=1+f(x)(x). [Note f(x) is in S so is a function: R -> R, f(x)(x) means 
we plug input x into this function.] <br>

Then clearly h is a function, h: R -> R and so h in S. <br>
By assumption this means that h=f(a) for some real number a. <br>
This is impossible since when we evaluate h at a, we get 1+f(a)(a) and 
so h has a different value from the function f(a) at a and so h cannot be 
f(a). <br> This is a contradiction to our original supposition and so 
we conclude R and S have different cardinalities. <br>

[Note: The constant functions in S are bijective to R via the bijection 
R -> Constant functions, taking a -> constant function with value a. 
Thus there is a subset of S with the same cardinality as R. Thus this 
justifies us saying "S has strictly larger cardinality than R" - for more 
details see books on Set theory and Logic.]

<P>2.18 Suppose that S were countable, then S={x(1),...,x(n),....}. <br>
Define a binary sequence {a(n)} as follows: <br>
a(n)=different value from nth term of sequence x(n). <br>
Then it is clear that the sequence {a(n)} is not any of the sequences x(m) 
listed since it will be different in the mth-term, but {a(n)} is in S. 
<br>
This is thus a contradiction to our original supposition and so S 
is indeed uncountable. <br>
