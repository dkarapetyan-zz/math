<P>22F: ``<-'' If we have continuous f: D -> R such that f(D)={0,1},
then if we SUPPOSE D is connected, since 0,1 in f(D), the intermediate 
value theorem says 1/2 in f(D) a contradiction since we had f(D)={0,1}. 
Thus we see D is disconnected. <br>
``->'' Suppose D is disconnected and let (U,V) be a disconnection for D.
Define a function f: D -> R by f(x)=1 if x in U int D and 
f(x)=0 if x in V int D. <br>
Since U int D and V int D are nonempty, f(D)={0,1}. It remains only to 
show that f is continuous. <br>
Let E > 0 and b in D. Now b either in U or V, since both U and V are open, 
we can find d > 0 such that d(x,b) < d implies x in U [in the case b in U]
or x in V [in the case b in V.] <br>
So for x in D, d(x,b) < d, we have f(x)=f(b) so |f(x)-f(b)| < E.
This shows that f is continuous at b. Since b in D was arbitrary, this 
shows f: D -> R is continuous.

<P>22J:[Maksim Orlovich's example:] <br> 
Let f(x)=x for x in (0,1) and f(0)=f(1)=1/2. Then on [0,1],
sup(f)=1 and inf(f)=0 are not achieved anywhere.

<P>22L: Claim: If p(x)=a(n)x^n + .... + a(0) is a polynomial of odd degree 
then lim p(x) as x goes to plus or minus infinity is infinite and further 
more is infinities of opposite sign as you go out in the two different 
directions of the real line. <br> (We will prove this claim at the end.)

Thus for example if a(n) > 0 then for 
x >> 0 (this means ``much greater than''), p(x) > 0 and for x << 0
we have p(x) < 0 since p(x) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem 
guarantees a root somewhere in between. <br>

Note if p(x) has even degree, it need not have a real root. For example 
p(x) = x^2 + 1. <br>

However p(x)=x^4 + 7x^3 - 9 has p(-10)=10000 - 7000 - 9=2,991 and <br>  
p(0)=-9 and p(2)=63. <br> Thus the intermediate value theorem guarantees a 
root of p(x) in (-10,0) and one in (0,2). So p(x) has at least two real 
roots. <br>

For completeness, we provide a proof of the claim for the case a(n) > 0. 
The case a(n) < 0 is similar. <br>

First let x > 1 and suppose let M=max(|a(n-1)|,..,|a(0)|). <br> 
Then 
p(x)=a(n)x^n + [a(n-1)x^(n-1) + .. + a(0)] >= a(n)x^n - [Mx^(n-1)+..+M] 
<br>
So p(x) >= a(n)x^n - Mnx^(n-1)=[a(n)x-M]x^(n-1). <br> 
Given N > 0 then for x > max(1,M, (N+M)/a(n)) we have:
p(x) >= [a(n)(N+M)/a(n)-M]x^(n-1) >=N. Thus we see that lim p(x) = +infty 
as x -> +infty. <br> 
Similar arguments can be used to find lim p(x)=-infty as x -> -infty. 

<P>22Q: Assume g takes each of its values exactly twice and 
SUPPOSE that g: I -> R is continuous. 
By the extreme value theorem, the mimimum of g on I, m 
and the maximum of g on I, M are achieved. Thus by the hypothesis there 
are exactly two points a(1) < a(2) such that g(a(1))=g(a(2))=m <br>and 
exactly two points b(1) < b(2) such that g(b(1))=g(b(2))=M. <br>
Note m not equal to M or else g is constant which would violate the 
condition that each value of g is achived exactly twice on I. <br>

There are 6 possible cases: <br>
(1): a(1) < a(2) < b(1) < b(2) <br>
(2): a(1) < b(1) < a(2) < b(2) <br>
(3): a(1) < b(1) < b(2) < a(2) <br>
(4): b(1) < a(1) < a(2) < b(2) <br>
(5): b(1) < a(1) < b(2) < a(2) <br>
(6): b(1) < b(2) < a(1) < a(2) <br>
Let L be such that m < L < M. Thus by the intermediate value theorem, 
between any b(i) and a(j) there is a point c such that g(c)=L. <br>
This shows that in cases (2) and (5) there are at least 3 points c where 
g(c)=L a contradiction so these cases are ruled out. <br>
Let S=sup g(x) for x in [a(1),a(2)]. Note m < S by necessity. Now 
by the extreme value theorem, for some y in (a(1),a(2)), g(y)=S.
Take H such that m < H < S, then by the intermediate value theorem, 
the value H is achieved somewhere in (a(1),y) and somewhere in (y,a(2)). 
<br>
In cases (1),(4) this value is also achieved in (a(2),b(2)) and so we get 
a contradictions as H is achieved more than twice. <br>
In case (6), this value is also achieved in (b(2),a(1)) and so we get 
a contradiction again. <br>
This leaves case (3). This can be done similarly by considering
T=inf g(x) for x in [b(1),b(2)] and noting T < M. Then again if 
T < H < M, H is achieved twice in (b(1),b(2)) but a third time also in 
(b(2),a(2)). <br>
This shows that all cases lead to a contradiction and so we conclude that 
g cannot be continuous.



<P>23H: f: (D,d) -> (M,d). <br>
We are given f is uniformly continuous on D and that (x(n)) is a Cauchy 
sequence in (D,d). <br>
Thus for any E > 0, there is L > 0 such that d(x,y) < L implies 
d(f(x),f(y)) < E for all x,y in D. <br>
Since (x(n)) is Cauchy, there is N, such that n,m >= N gives d(x(n),x(m)) 
< L. <br>
Putting these together we see d(f(x(n)),f(x(m))) < E for n,m >=N. <br>
Thus we see (f(x(n)) is a Cauchy sequence in (M,d). <br>

<P>23I: f: (0,1) -> R is uniformly continuous. <br>
Let (x(n)) a sequence in (0,1), converging to 0 in R. <br>
Then (x(n)) is a Cauchy sequence in (0,1). <br>
By Ex23H, (f(x(n)) is a Cauchy sequence in R. <br>
Thus lim f(x(n)) = L exists as R is complete. <br>
Now if (y(n)) is another sequence in (0,1) converging to 0 in R. <br>
Then lim f(y(n)) = L' exists by similar arguments. <br>
We want to show L=L'. <br>
Note Z=(x(1),y(1),x(2),y(2),....) is a sequence in (0,1) converging to 0 
in 
R. <br>
Thus by similar arguments lim(f(Z)) exists. But then any subsequence of 
f(Z) has the same limit and so L=L'. <br>
So if we define F: [0,1) -> R by F(x)=f(x) for x in (0,1) and F(0)=L, 
then F will be continuous at 0. <br>
It is continuous at b in (0,1) since in some open nhd of b it equals f 
which is continuous at b. <br>
Similar arguments show we can extend F continuously to the point x=1. <br>


<P>23L: f: I -> I continous. We want to show f(c)=c for some c 
in I=[0,1]. <br>
Define g(x)=f(x)-x then g: I -> R is continuous. <br>
f(0) in [0,1] and if f(0)=0 we can use c=0 so WLOG f(0) > 0. <br>.
Similarly f(1) < 1. <br>
Thus g(0)=f(0)-0 > 0 and g(1)=f(1)-1 < 0 and so by the intermediate value 
theorem, there is c in (0,1) such that g(c)=0. Thus f(c)=c as we desired. 
<br>

<P>24B: f_n(x)=1/n if x is in Q and f_n(x)=0 if x is not in Q. 
Then f_n is everywhere discontinuous but if f is the zero function then 
|f_n(x)-f(x)| <= 1/n for all x so f_n converges uniformly to f. <br> 
Notice that f is certainly continuous everywhere. <br>

<P>24E(b): For x > 1, x^n -> infty as n -> infty and so 
f_n(x) -> 1. <br>
For 0 <= x < 1, x^n -> 0 as n -> infty and so f_n(x) -> 0. <br>
For x=1, f_n(1)=1/2 so f_n(1) -> 1/2. <br>
Thus the sequence of functions (f_n) converge pointwise to f given by: 
<br>
f(x)=1 if x > 1, 0 if 0 <= x < 1, 1/2 if x =1. <br>
Since the f_n are continuous on [0,infty) but f is not, we see that the 
convergence cannot be uniform on [0,infty). <br>
However if 0 <= c < 1, then on [0,c] we have <br>
||f_n - f|| = sup[x in [0,c]] ( x^n/(1+x^n) )= c^n/(1+c^n). <br>
(To see this, note by taking a derivative, we see x^n/(1+x^n) is 
increasing everywhere on 
its domain.) <br>
Since c < 1, as n -> infty, ||f_n-f|| -> 0 and so we see f_n converge 
uniformly to f on [0,c]. <br>
Similar for 1 < d we have on [d, infty): <br>
||f_n - f|| = sup(on [d,infty) ) |x^n/(1+x^n)-1| =sup on [d,infty) 
1/(x^n+1)=1/(d^n+1). <br>
Since d > 1, ||f_n-f|| -> 0 as n -> infty and so we see f_n converge 
uniformly to f on [d,infty) too. <br>

<P>24S: Define f: (0,1) -> R by f(x)=1/x. Then f is an unbounded 
continuous function on this interval. Let p(x) be a polynomial, then since 
p is continuous on R, by the extreme value theorem, p is bounded on [0,1] 
and hence on (0,1). Thus we see {f(x)-p(x) | x in (0,1)} is a set which is 
not bounded above. <br> Thus it is impossible to find a polynomial p such 
that |f(x)-p(x)| < 1 uniformly throughout (0,1). <br>
Thus the Weierstrass approximation theorem fails for open bounded 
intervals. <br>

<P>26B: We use the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem. <br>
The family is A={functions of the form a(n)cos(x)^n +....+a(1)cos(x) + 
a(0), where a(i) are real scalars.} <br>
Condition (a): e(x)=1 is in A as this is the case a(n)=..=a(1)=0,a(0)=1. 
<br>
Conditions (b),(c): Easy to check. <br>
Condition (d): cos(x) is in A. Note cos(x) is 1-1 on [0,pi] and so 
for x not y in this interval, we have cos(x) not cos(y) so (d) holds.
Thus we are done by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. <br>

<P>26D: If we look at the family 
A={functions of the form a(n)sin(x)^n + ... + a(0) | a(i) real scalars.} 
<br>
Then note on [0,pi] we have sin(0)=sin(pi)=0 and thus for any f in A, 
we have f(0)=f(pi). <br>
Now let g(x)=x, then g is continuous on [0,pi], g(0)=0 and g(pi)=pi. <br>
Let 0 < E < pi/3. <br>
If f in A, had |f(x)-g(x)| < E for all x in [0,pi] then <br>
|f(0)-g(0)|=|f(0)-0| < E and |f(pi)-g(pi)|=|f(0)-pi| < E. This is 
impossible since |pi - 0| > 3E. <br>
Thus the functions in the family A do not uniformly approximate arbitrary  
continuous functions on [0,pi]. <br>
