#4:  U open in X and A closed in X then X-U closed in X and X-A open in X. 
<br>
Thus U-A=U intersection (X-A) is the intersection of two open sets and 
hence is open. <br>
Also A-U=A intersection (X-U) is the intersection of two closed sets and 
hence is closed. <br>

<P>
#12: Let A be a subspace of X, X Hausdorff. 
Given a,b in A distinct points, since X is Hausdorff we can find U,V open 
in X, U int V=empty, a in U, b in V. <br>
Then U'=U int A, V'=V int A are open in A, a in U', b in V' and U' int V' 
= empty set. Thus A is Hausdorff also. <br>

<P>
#13: Let D denote the diagonal of X x X here. <br>
(A) X Hausdorff -> D closed in X x X. <br>
Pf: Let (a,b) be in X x X - D, then a not equal to b in X. <br>
Since X is Hausdorff, we can find U nhd of a and V nhd of b such that 
U intersection V is empty. <br>
Then (a,b) in U x V open in X x X. Also note if (z,z) in U x V 
then z in U intersection V, a contradiction to U,V being disjoint so 
U x V subset X x X - D. Thus we see X x X - D is open. <br>
Thus D is closed. QED. <br>
(B) D closed in X x X -> X Hausdorff. <br>
We reverse the steps. D closed in X x X says X x X - D is open. 
Now if a,b in X are distinct then (a,b) in X x X - D but since X x X - D 
is open we can find basis set U x V such that (a,b) in U x V subset X x X 
-D. Since U x V does not intersect D we conclude that U and V are disjoint 
open sets of X. Since a in U and b in V, we conclude X is indeed 
Hausdorff. QED. <br>

#16: (a) <br>
Standard topology: closure(K)=K union {0}. <br>
K-topology: closure(K)=K. <br>
(Note R-K=[(-100,100)-K] union (99,infty) union 
(-infty,-99)] and these three pieces are open in the K-topology so R-K is 
open in the K-topology and so K is closed in the K-topology.) <br>
Finite complement topology: closure(K)=R. <br>
This is because if a in R, then a nhd of a in the finite complement 
topology is of the form R-F, F a finite set. Since K is infinite we see 
R-F must intersect K and so every nhd of a intersects K, so a in 
closure(K). <br>
Upper limit topology: closure(K)=K. <br>
R-K=(-infty,0] Union A(n) Union (1,infty) where A(n)=(1/(n+1),1/n) and 
union is over all n in Z+. Each of these pieces is open in the upper limit 
topology (which is finer than the standard topology) and so R-K is open in 
the upper limit topology and so K is closed in this topology. <br>
Ray topology, basis (-infty,a): closure(K)={x in R | x >= 0}. <br>
If b in R, b >= 0 and b in (-infty,a) then a > b and so a > 0. 
Thus (-infty,a) intersects K. So b in closure(K). On the other hand if b < 
0, then b in (-infty, b/2) which is disjoint from K so b not in 
closure(K). <br>
(b): Note Hausdorff -> T_1 <br>
Standard Topology: Hausdorff. <br>
K-topology: Hausdorff (finer than standard). <br>
Finite complement topology: T_1 but not Hausdorff. <br>
This is since {x} has complement R-{x} which is open in finite complement 
topology since |{x}|=1 is finite. Thus {x} is closed in this topology. 
On the other hand given a,b distinct, U nhd of a, V nhd of B in this 
topology then U=R-F, V=R-F' where F, F' are finite. Since F union F' is 
finite and R is infinite there must be x in R-(F union F') and this x 
will be in both U and V so U and V intersect. Thus this topology is not 
Hausdorff. <br>
Upper Limit Topology: Hausdorff (finer than standard.) <br>
Ray topology: Neither. <br>
It is not T_1 since if {x} is a point, then R-{x}=(-infty,x) union 
(x,infty) and if y in (x, infty), no basis element around y lies inside 
R-{x}. Thus R-{x} is not open in this topology and so {x} is not closed in 
this topology. If a space is not T_1, it cannot be Hausdorff.
