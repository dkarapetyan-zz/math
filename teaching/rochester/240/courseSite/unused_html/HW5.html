#3: Note since all the sets are subsets of Y, if they are open in R, 
they will automatically be open in Y. <BR>
A is open in R and in Y as A=(-1,-1/2) union (1/2,1)= union of two R-basis 
elements. <br>
B is not open in R but open in Y. B is not open in R as 1 in B but there 
is no interval (a,b) such that 1 in (a,b) subset B. B is open in Y since 
it is the intersection of the open set (-100,-1/2) union (1/2,100) of 
R with Y. <br>
C is not open in Y or R since 1/2 in C but there is no (a,b) such that 
1/2 in (a,b) subset C. <br>
D is not open in Y or R for the same reason as for C. <br>
1/x not in Z+ is the same as saying x not equal to 1/n for any n in Z+,
thus E=(-1,1)-{0,1/n | n in Z+}=(-1,0) union A(n) where 
A(n)=(1/(n+1),1/n) and the union is over all n in Z+. This is a union of 
open sets in R so is open in R and hence also open in Y. <br>

#4: Consider a basis open set U x V of X x Y where U open in X and V open 
in Y. Note pi_1(U x V)= U if V is not empty and the empty set if V is 
empty. Either case, pi_1(U x V) is open in X. <br>
Now if W is an open set of X x Y, then W = Union U(i) x V(i) for i in some 
index set. Then pi_1(W)= Union pi_1(U(i) x V(i)) [Exercise 2(f) Pg 21]
and so pi_1(W) is the union of open sets of X and hence is open in X. 
Thus we have seen W open in X x Y -> pi_1(W) open in X and so pi_1 is an 
open map. The proof that pi_2 : X x Y -> Y is open is similar.

#6: For any ((x,y)) (I will use ((-)) for Cartesian pairs here and 
(-,-) for intervals) there are rational numbers a,b,c,d such that 
a < x < b and c < y < d and so ((x,y)) in (a,b) x (c,d). 
So ((x,y)) lies in some "rational square". <br>
Also note for a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h rational, we have 
[(a,b) x (c,d)] intersect [(e,f) x (g,h)] = 
(max(a,e),min(b,f)) x (max(c,g),min(d,h)) which is another rational 
square. So if B(1) and B(2) are two rational squares and ((x,y)) in B(1) 
int 
B(2) we can use B(3)=B(1) intersect B(2) since this is also a rational 
square, so ((x,y)) in B(3) subset B(1) intersect B(2) trivially in this 
case. 
<br>
Thus the rational squares are a basis for a topology on R^2 - it remains 
to show that this gives the standard topology of the plane given by the 
basis of ALL squares (a,b) x (c,d). 
First of all, it is clear given B a rational square and ((x,y)) in B 
we can find a usual square B' such that ((x,y)) in B' subset B since we 
can just 
use B'=B. 
So we mainly have to look at ((x,y)) in B'=(a,b) x (c,d) a usual square 
and find 
a rational square B such that ((x,y)) in B subset B'.
Well a < x < b and c < y < d. But between any two real numbers, we can 
find a rational number and so we can find q(1),q(2),q(3),q(4) rational 
such that a < q(1) < x < q(2) < b and c < q(3) < y < q(4) < d. 
Then if B=(q(1),q(2)) x (q(3),q(4)) we have ((x,y)) in B subset B'.

So by lemma 13.3, the topology defined by all the squares is the same as 
the topology defined by the rational squares.

Note this shows that R^2 does have a countable basis, since the 
collection of all rational squares is countable. (Since it bijects with Q 
x Q which is countable)

<P>
#8: This is best done by drawing pictures so let me just state the 
answers: <br>
In R_l x R: <br>
Vertical lines inherit the standard topology of the line while lines of 
any other slope inherit the lower limit topology. <br>
In R_l x R_l: <br>
Lines of nonnegative slope inherit the lower limit topology while lines of 
negative slope inherit the discrete topology.

<P>
#9: Note R_d has a basis collection { {x} | x in R} consisting of the 
singleton sets. Thus R_d x R has a basis of sets of the form {x} x (a,b) 
which are small open-ended vertical line segments. 
Notice all the basis sets for R_d x R are open in the dictionary topology 
and vice versa (the "bigger intervals" in the dictionary topology are 
unions of the "smaller" vertical line segments and so are still open in 
the R_d x R topology.). Thus the open sets in both topologies are the same 
and so R_d x R is the same topology as R^2 with the dictionary topology. 

Given a open basis set B=(a,b) x (c,d) for the product topology of R^2 
and ((x,y)) in B, it is clear that we can find a vertical segment B' 
such that ((x,y)) in B' subset B. Thus the product topology will be 
coarser than the dictionary topology by Lemma 13.3. On 
the other hand the vertical segment {1} x (5,7) is not open in the usual 
topology and so Usual topology is a strict subset of Dictionary topology.
(In other words the standard topology is strictly coarser than the 
dictionary topology.)

<P>
#10: All three topologies are different. Let us call the 
topology inherited from (R^2,dictionary) the subspace dictionary 
topology for the remainder of this problem. <br>
Consider U=(0.4,0.6) x [0,0.2) in I x I, this is open in the product 
topology of I x I as [0,0.2),(0.4,0.6) are open in I=[0,1]. <br>
However in the dictionary topology of I x I, any nhd of ((0.5,0)) 
has to go outside of U so U is not open in the dictionary topology of 
I x I. Also U = union [((x,0)),((x,0.2)) ) where 0.4 < x < 0.6 and 
this union is over half-open vertical line segments. Thus U is open 
in the subspace topology from (R^2,dictionary).
Thus  U shows that (I x I, dictionary) is different from the other two. 
<br>
Now consider V={((1/2,y)) | 0.2 < y < 0.8 }, V is open in 
the dictionary and subspace dictionary topologies but not the product 
topology. This shows product topology is different from the other two.
<br>
Thus we have seen all 3 topologies are distinct and the product topology 
and dictionary topology are incomparable. It is not hard to show by 
considering the basis elements that the subspace dictionary topology is 
finer than the other two since the basis elements of the other two are 
open in the subspace dictionary topology. <br>
