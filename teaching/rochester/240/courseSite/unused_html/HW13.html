<P>27D: For points b other than 0, g(x) equals the top formula in an open 
neighborhood of b so we may concentrate on this formula to find the 
derivative. Using the chain rule and product rule from calculus one finds: 
<br>
g'(x)= x^2 (-1/x^2)cos(1/x) + 2xsin(1/x) for x not zero. <br>
g'(x)= 2xsin(1/x) - cos(1/x) for x not zero. <br>
On the other hand for x=0, we use the definition of g'(0) to get: <br>
g'(0)=lim [g(x)-g(0)]/[x-0]. <br>
Since this is a deleted limit, we use the top row to plug in for g(x) and 
get: <br>
g'(0)=lim [x^2sin(1/x)]/[x]=lim [xsin(1/x)]. <br>
Now |xsin(1/x)| <= |x| so as x->0, xsin(1/x) -> 0 and so g'(0)=0. <br>
Thus g is differentiable at all real numbers. <br>
However lim g'(x) as x -> 0 does not exist. <br>
Thus is because if x(n)=1/[2npi] then x(n) -> 0 but g'(x(n))=-1 for all n 
and so g'(x(n)) -> -1. <br>
On the other hand if y(n)=1/[(2n+1)pi] then y(n) -> 0 but g'(y(n))=1 
for all n so g'(y(n)) -> 1. <br>
Since 1 not equal to -1 and neither is equal to g'(0)=0, we see that 
g'(x) is not continuous at x=0. <br>

<P>27E: Let b be irrational and let x(n) -> b be a sequence of rationals. 
<br>
Then h(x(n))=x(n)^2 -> b^2 and so h is continuous at b only if 
b^2=h(b)=0. This happens only if b=0 which is not an irrational so we see 
h is not continuous at any irrational. <br>
Now let c be a rational and let y(n) -> c be a sequence of irrationals. 
<br>
Then h(y(n))=0 and h is continuous at c only if h(c)=c^2=0 or only if c=0. 
<br> It is easy to check that h is indeed continuous at x=0. <br>
So we see h'(b) won't exist unless maybe b=0. <br>
Now h'(0)=lim[h(x)-h(0)]/[x-0] if it exists. <br>
So h'(0)=lim h(x)/x <br>
h(x)/x is 0 if x is irrational and x if x is rational. So either way, 
given E > 0 for |x-0| < E, we have |h(x)/x - 0| <  E. <br> 
Thus h'(0)=0. <br>

<P>27H: f'(a)=A, f'(b)=B. WLOG let A <= B. <br>
(Since if not then B <= A so look at 
-f this has (-f)'(a)=-A <= (-f)'(b)=-B and for any -A <= -C <= -B if 
(-f)'(c)=-C then f'(c)=C.) <br>
Note if C=A use f'(a)=C and if C=B use f'(b)=C so WLOG A < C < B. <br>
Now let g(x)=f(x)-C(x-a). <br>
Then g'(x)=f'(x)-C for x in [a,b]. <br>
Since g is differentiable on [a,b], it is continuous on [a,b] and so 
achieves its minimum m at c in [a,b]. <br>
Now g'(a)=f'(a)-C=A-C < 0 and g'(b)=f'(b)-C=B-C > 0 so we see that 
g cannot have its minimum at x=a or at x=b. <br>
So a < c < b and by the interior minimum theorem, g'(c)=0. <br>
Thus f'(c)-C=0 so f'(c)=C as desired. <br>

<P>27I: If g=f' for some f then f'(-10)=0 and f'(10)=1 so by 27H applied 
to f on [-10,10] we conclude there is c in (-10,10) such that 
f'(c)=g(c)=1/2. But this is not true. So we see g is not f' on R for any 
f. <br>
(Remark: Of course if f(x)=0 for x <= 0 and f(x)=x for x > 0 then 
f'(x)=g(x) for all nonzero x but f'(0) does not exist. The exercise shows 
it is impossible for g=f' for all x.) <br>

<P>27T: Define P: [a,b] -> R by P(x)=x - f(x)/M. <br>
Note  0 <= P'(x)=1 - f'(x)/M <= 1-m/M. <br>
So P is increasing and a contraction with contraction constant 1-m/M by 
27.9(vii). <br>
Note for a <= x <= b we have P(a) <= P(x) <= P(b) since P increasing. <br>
P(a)=a-f(a)/M > a since f(a) < 0 and P(b)=b-f(b)/M < b since f(b) > 0. 
<br>
Thus a < P(a) <= P(x) <= P(b) < b and so P([a,b]) subset [a,b]. <br>
Note that x(n+1)=P(x(n)). This last fact shows x(n+1) is well defined 
since x(n) will be in [a,b]=Domain(P) since x(1) was and so P(x(n)) will 
make sense. 
<br>
The contraction mapping theorem then guarantees the sequence (x(n)) 
converges to the unique fixed point of P, call it x^. <br>
So P(x^)=x^ and so x^-f(x^)/M=x^ so f(x^)=0. <br>
Thus x^ is the unique zero of f in [a,b]. <br>
Also by the error bound on page 162 (23.6): <br>
|x^ - x(n+1)| <= [C^n/(1-C)]|x(2)-x(1)| <br>
Here C=1-m/M is the contraction constant. <br>
Computing x(2)=P(x(1))=x(1)-f(x(1))/M so |x(2)-x(1)|=|f(x(1))|/M. <br>
So we get: <br>
|x^-x(n+1)| <= [(1-m/M)^n/(m/M)]|f(x(1))/M| = desired expression. <br>

<P>27U: Let the setup be as in the question and |y^-b| <= ETA. <br>
Let P(x)=x-(f(x)-y^)/f'(a) for x in [a-d,a+d] <br>
Then P'(x)=1 - f'(x)/f'(a). <br>
Since |f'(x)-f'(a)| <= [1/2]f'(a) on [a-d,a+d] we have 
  [1/2]f'(a) <= f'(x) <= [3/2] f'(a) on this interval. <br>
So -1/2 <= P'(x) <= 1/2 on this interval so <br>
|P'(x)| <= 1/2 on [a-d,a+d] so by 27.9(vii), P is a contraction with 
contraction constant 1/2 on this interval. <br>
In order to apply the contraction mapping principle, we need to show 
P([x-d,x+d]) subset [a-d,a+d]. <br>
This is to make the sequence x(n+1)=P(x(n)) well defined. <br>
(Since domain(P)=[a-d,a+d].) <br>
So let z in [a-d,a+d] then <br>
|P(z)-P(a)| <= 1/2|z-a| <= [1/2]d. <br>
However P(a)=a - (f(a)-y^)/f'(a) = a - (b-y^)/f'(a) so <br>
|P(a)-a|=|b-y^|/|f'(a)| <= ETA/|f'(a)|=[1/2]d. <br>
Thus |P(z)-a| <= |P(z)-P(a)| + |P(a)-a| <= [1/2]d + [1/2]d = d. <br>
Thus P(z) in [a-d,a+d] as desired. <br>

Thus the contraction mapping principle says (x(n)) converges to x^, the 
unique fixed point of P in [a-d,a+d]. <br>
Note P(x^)=x^ if and only if x^-(f(x^)-y^)/f'(a)=x^ if and only if 
f(x^)=y^. So x^ is the unique point in [a-d,a+d] such that f(x^)=y^. 
<br>
Thus we see f: [x-d,x+d] -> [b-ETA,b+ETA] is a bijection. <br>
(Note f^(-1) is continuous automatically by 22.9 thus 
f: [x-d,x+d] -> [b-ETA, b+ETA] is a homeomorphism for those in the know.)
 <br>

<P>28K: The remainder in the Taylor expansion for e^x looks like: <br>
R(n)=e^c (b-a)^n/n! for some c in [a,b]. <br>
Note since e^x is continuous on R, it is bounded by B on [a,b] so this 
remainder has |R(n)| <= B |b-a|^n/n! and so to show R(n) -> 0, it is 
enough to show <br>
M^n/n! -> 0 as n -> infty for any M >= 0. <br>
Also note since 0 <= M^n/n! <= (Roundup(M))^n/n! it is enough to do this 
for M a positive integer. <br>

Now for n > M, <br>
M^n/n! = M x M x ... x M / n x (n-1) x ..... x 1. <br>
= (M^M/M!)(M^(n-M)/n x (n-1) x....x (M+1) <br> 
<= (M^M/M!)[M/(M+1)]^(n-M) <br>
Finally since 0 <= M/(M+1) < 1 we have (M/(M+1))^(n-M) -> 0 as n -> infty. 
<br>
Thus we are done. <br>

<P>29J: I(f)=``integral on [a,b] of fdx ''. <br>
We are given I(f) exists. <br>
Now let g be such that it equals f except at the finite set of points 
y(1),...,y(N) in [a,b]. <br>
Let M=Max(|f(y(i))-g(y(i))|, i=1,..,N). <br>
Given E > 0. Let D= E/2NM. 
<br> Then let P(E) be a partition which contains 
the points y(i) and y(i) + D and y(i)-D for i=1,2,..,N as long as these 
are in [a,b]. <br>
Now let P=(x(0),..,x(n)) be a refinement of P(E). <br>
Now if S(P,f) is a Riemann sum for f and S(P,g) is a Riemann sum for g 
using the same intermediary points "xi_i" then: <br>
|S(P,f)-S(P,g)| <= M Sum (x(i)-x(i-1)) where the sum only involves 
the intervals [x(i-1),x(i)] which contain a y(j). <br>
Since there are N y(j)'s there are at most N such intervals and since P 
is a refinement of P(E), each of these intervals has length at most D so 
we get: <br>
|S(P,f)-S(P,g)| <= MND=E/2. <br>
Since I(f) exists, there is partition Q(E) such that P refinement of Q(E) 
gives: <br>
|S(P,f)-I(f)| < E/2. <br> 
So if P is a refinement of Q(E) union P(E) then putting these together we 
get: <br>
|S(P,g)-I(f)| < |S(P,g)-S(P,f)| + |S(P,f)-I(f)| < E/2 + E/2 = E. <br>
Thus we see I(g) exists and equals I(f). <br>
