<P>1: <BR> More generally let us check that if = is an equivalence 
relation (like say equality!) on B and f: A -> B. Then if we set u ~ v in 
A iff f(u)=f(v), 
~ will be an equivalence relation on A. <br>
[In our case: A is R^2, B is R with the usual = and f(x,y)=y-x^2.] <br>
REFLEXIVE: u ~ u as f(u)=f(u). <br>
SYMMETRIC: u ~ v -> f(u)=f(v) -> f(v)=f(u) -> v ~ u. <br>
TRANSITIVE: u ~ v and v ~ z -> f(u)=f(v) and f(v)=f(z) -> f(u)=f(z) -> u ~ 
z. <br>
Back to our example, the equivalence classes are parabolas of the form 
y-x^2=a for various constants a. <br> 

<P>4(a): Follows from proof of 1 above. <br>
(b): Define g: A* -> B by g([a]) = f(a). This is a well-defined function, 
i.e. does not have multiple outputs for a single input, as if [a]=[x] 
then a ~ x and so f(a)=f(x) by definition and so g([a])=g([x]). <br>
Now as f was onto, for b in B, there is a in A such that f(a)=b and 
hence g([a])=b so g is onto also. <br>
Now if g([a])=g([c]) then f(a)=f(c) and so a ~ c. Thus [a]=[c]. 
So we conclude g is one-to-one also. Thus g is bijective. <br>

<P>6: Let f: R^2 -> R be given by f(x,y)=y-x^2 for this problem. <BR>
Given (u,v), (x,y), by trichotomy for usual (R,<), either: <br>
(a) f(u,v) < f(x,y). In this case (u,v) < (x,y). <br>
(b) f(u,v) > f(x,y). In this case (x,y) < (u,v). <br>
(c) f(u,v)=f(x,y). Now in this case if u < x or x < u we can still 
compare the vectors, we only need check if it is possible u=x also. 
Well if u=x and f(u,v)=f(x,y) we get v-u^2=y-x^2 and so v=y since u=x. 
Thus (u,v)=(x,y). <br>
So in all cases we see either (u,v) < (x,y), (x,y) < (u,v) or (x,y)=(u,v). 
<br>
It only remains to check transitivity which is tedious but 
straightforward. <br>
To picture, note that on a given parabola f(x,y)=c=constant, 
the vectors "get larger in the ordering" as we move to the right. <br>
On the other hand all the vectors on the parabola f(x,y)=c 
are larger than those on f(x,y)=d when c > d. <br>


<P>12: <br>
(i): (n,1) do not have immediate predecessors for any n in Z+, <br>
(m,n) has immediate predecessor (m,n-1) for n > 1. <br>
(1,1) is the smallest element. <br>
<br>
(ii): considering lines x-y=c=constant, we see that on y=x-c, 
the ordering is increasing as we go upward, and also points on the 
line y=x-c are bigger than those on the line y=x-d if c > d. <br>
With this we see: <br>
There is no smallest element as (m,n) > (m,n+1) for all m,n in Z+. <br>
On each y=x-c line, all element have predecessors except the ones 
that are bottomost i.e., of the form (c+1,1). <br>
<br>
(iii): considering lines x+y=c=constant, we see that on y=-x+c, 
the ordering is increasing as we go upward, and also points on the line 
y=-x+c are bigger than those on the line y=-x+d if c > d. <br>
With this we see: <br>
(1,1) is the smallest element as for any other element (m,n) in Z+ x Z+ we 
have m+n > 1+1=2. <br>
if (m,n) on the line x+y=c is not "bottomost" i.e., not (c-1,1), 
it has predecessor, (m+1,n-1). <br> 
On the other hand if it is bottomost, then note the predecessor of (c-1,1) 
is the topmost element of the next lower line x+y=c-1, or in other words 
(1,c-2). This works as long as we are not on the "lowest line" i.e. 
as long as we are not looking at (1,1) which is the only element 
with no predecessor in this ordering. <br>
Since (ii) has no smallest element it is not of the order type of (i) or 
(iii). <br>
(i) is not of the order type of (iii) since (i) has infinitely many 
elements with no immediate predecessor while (iii) has only got one 
such element (1,1). <br>

<P>4: <BR> Choose some element say 0 in X (of course X need not actually  
have zero in it but we will just use this symbolically for any chosen 
element from X) for the rest of the exercise. <br>
(a) f(x(1),..,x(m))=(x(1),..,x(m),0,0,0,..,0) 
is an injective map f: X^m -> X^n for n >= m. (Use n-m 0's.) <br>
(b) g((a(1),..,a(m)),(b(1),..,b(n)))=(a(1),..,a(m),b(1),..,b(n)) 
is a bijection X^m x X^n -> X^(m+n). <br>
(c) h(b(1),..,b(n))=(b(1),..,b(n),0,0,......) is an injection 
h: X^n -> X^Omega. <br>
(d) k((a(1),a(2),..,a(n)), (b(1),b(2),...))=(a(1),..,a(n),b(1),b(2),....) 
is a bijection X^n x X^Omega -> X^Omega. <br>
(e) l((a(1),a(2),...),(b(1),b(2),...))=(a(1),b(1),a(2),b(2),......) is 
a bijection X^Omega x X^Omega -> X^Omega. <br>
(f) m( (x(m,1)),...,(x(m,n)) ) = 
(x(1,1),x(1,2),..,x(1,n),x(2,1),..,x(2,n)..) <br>
is a bijection where (x(m,1)) is the first sequence (in m) and (x(m,2)) is 
the second and so forth. <br>

<P>5: <BR>
(a) Z^Omega. YES. <BR>
(b) x A(i), where A(i)={i,i+1,..}. YES. <BR>
(c) R x ... x R x Z x Z x...., [99 R's]. YES. <BR>
(d) NO. Since if we set A={(x(n)) in R^Omega | x(2)=x(3)} then 
the constant sequences are all in A. Thus if A were to be a Cartesian 
product of subsets of R, since any real number occurs as the second/third  
coordinate of some element of A, we have A=R x R x R x....=R^Omega 
which is not true since (1,2,3,4,...) is not in A. <br>
