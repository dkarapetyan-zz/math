#1(a): d_1=metric described. It is pretty clear that 
d_1(X,Y)=d_1(Y,X) and that d_1(X,Y) >= 0 and equals zero only if X=Y. <br>
So we will concentrate on showing the triangle inequality. <br>
Let X=(X(1),..,X(N)), Y=(Y(1),...,Y(N)), Z=(Z(1),...,Z(N)). <br>
Then since d(a,b)=|a-b| is a metric on R, we have for each 1 <= k <= N, 
<br>
|X(k)-Y(k)| <= |X(k)-Z(k)| + |Z(k)-Y(k)| <br>
Adding these inequalities for k=1,2...,N gives us the desired inequality: 
<BR>
d_1(X,Y) <= d_1(X,Z) + d_1(Z,Y). <br>

In R^2, the basis elements look like "diamonds". For example,
B_(d_1)(origin,1) is equal to
{(x,y) | d_1((x,y),(0,0)) < 1}={(x,y) | |x| + |y| < 1}. <br>
This has boundary the set of (x,y) with |x|+|y|=1 or 
y = plus minus (1 plus minus x). <br>

If p is the square metric, p(X,Y)=max(|X(k)-Y(k)|) then we have:

p(X,Y) <= d_1(X,Y) <= np(X,Y). <br>

The first inequality gives:
B_{d_1}(X,E) = { Y | d_1(X,Y) < E} subset {Y | p(X,Y) < E} = B_p(X,E). 
<br>

The second inequality gives:
B_p(X,E)={ Y | p(X,Y) < E} subset {Y | d_1(X,Y) < nE} = B_{d_1}(X,nE). 
<br>

This shows that it is always possible to fit one sort of metric ball into 
the other sort about any point X so by lemma 13.3, d_1 defines the same 
topology on R^n as p did, which is the standard product topology by Thm 
20.3. <br>

<P>
#2: (R x R, dictionary) = R_discrete x R by Ex 9 page 92. <br>
By Ex 3 page 133 of this HW set, a metric that gives this topology can be 
obtained from the metrics giving the topology for the factors. <br>
Note D(a,b)=1 if a not equal to b, 0 if a equals b gives the discrete 
topology on R. <br>
Thus pf we set p((x,y),(x',y'))=max(D(x,x'),|y-y'|), this will 
give us a metric on R x R which gives the dictionary topology as its 
metric topology, by Ex 3, page 133. <br>
Thus the dictionary topology of the plane is metrizable. <br>

<P>
#4: (a) <br>
To test F: R -> (R^omega,product) is continuous, one uses Thm 19.6, which 
says F is continuous if and only if each of its coordinate functions 
f_n: R -> R is continuous. <br>
In this case a simple glance lets us know that f,g,h are all continuous 
if the product topology is used for R^omega. <br>

To test F: R -> (R^omega, box) is continuous we have no Thm so we have to 
resort to seeing if the preimage of open sets are open. <br>

Consider the box U: <br>
U=(-1,1) x (-1/4,1/4) x (-1/9,1/9) x .... x(-1/n^2,1/n^2)x..... <br>
U is open in (R^omega,box). <br>
f^{-1}(U)<br>
={t| such that nt in (-1/n^2,1/n^2) for all n} <br>
={t | -1/n^2 < nt < 1/n^2 for all n in Z+} <br>
={0} not open in R. <br>
Thus f not continuous. <br>
Similarly g^{-1}(U)={t| -1/n^2 < t < 1/n^2 for all n in Z+} ={0} <br>
and h^{-1}(U)={t| -1/n^2 < t/n < 1/n^2 for all n in Z+}={0} <br>
and so none of f,g,h is continuous if the box topology is used for 
R^omega. <br>
The uniform topology is a metric topology. In this case, usually using 
the criterion of Thm 21.3 is the easiest thing to do to check continuity. 
<br>
Thus F: R -> (R^omega,uniform) is cts if and only if
(whenever t(n) -> t in R, p(F(t(n)),F(t)) -> 0 where p is the 
uniform-metric. <br>
Note f(t(n))=(t(n),2t(n),3t(n),....) <br>
f(t)=(t,2t,3t,4t,....) <br>
So p(f(t),f(t(n))= 1 (infty cutoff) if t(n) not equal to t and 0 if 
t(n)=t. <br>
So it is possible t(n) -> t but p(f(t),f(t(n)) does not go to 0 for 
example 1/n -> 0 but p(f(1/n),f(0)) does not go to 0. So f is not 
continuous if R^omega is given the uniform topology. <br>
For g, one computes p(g(t),g(t(n)))=min(|t-t(n)|,1) which does go to zero 
as t(n) -> t and so g is continuous in the uniform topology. <br>
For h, one computes p(h(t),h(t(n)))=min(sup_over_k(|t-t(n)|/k),1) 
=min(|t-t(n)|,1) which does go to zero as t(n) -> t and so 
h is also continuous in the uniform topology. <br>
(b) By Ex6 page 118, to see what these families of sequences converge to 
in (R^omega, product), one just looks coordinatewise, i.e., at each 
column, we look at the sequence of real numbers in that column and see if 
it converges to something. <br>
Thus in (R^omega,product), X_k -> X if and only if it converges 
"coordinatewise". <br>
So for the 
X_k, W_k, Y_k, Z_k, they all converge to the zero sequence O in the 
product topology, since each of the columns in these families has 
coordinates converging to zero. <br>


Now since (R^omega, product) is Hausdorff, we know none of these sequences 
of sequences have any other limit but the zero sequence in this topology. 
<br>

Since the box and uniform topologies are finer than the product topology 
(Thm 20.4), we know that in these other topologies, these sequence of 
sequences cannot possibly converge to anything else than what they did in 
the product topology, i.e., O=Zero sequence. However in these finer 
topologies they might not converge to that either!! So we have to check 
that!!! <br>

Uniform topology: <br>
p(W_k,O)=1 (k cutoff). Thus W_k do NOT converge to O uniformly (in the 
uniform topology). <br>
p(X_k,O)=1/k -> 0 as k -> infty so X_k converge to O uniformly. <br>
p(Y_k,O)=1/k -> 0 as k -> infty so Y_k converge to O uniformly. <br>
p(Z_k,O)=1/k -> 0 as k -> infty so Z_k converge to O uniformly. <br>

Box topology: <br>
Consider U = (-1,1) x (-1/2,1/2) x ... x (-1/n,1/n) x .... <br>
Note U is open nhd of O in the box topology. <br>
The nth coordinate of W_n, X_n and Y_n is not STRICTLY less than 1/n and 
so W_n,X_n,Y_n are not in U for any n. <br> 
Thus W_n, X_n, Y_n sequences do NOT converge to O in the box topology. 
<br>
On the other hand let W=(a(1),b(1)) x ... x (a(n),b(n)) x ... 
be a general box neighborhood of O. Then a(n) < 0 < b(n) for all n. <br>
Let N be big enough so that j > N gives 1/j < min(b(1),b(2)). <br>
Then note Z_k is in W for k > N. This is because its first and second 
coordinates are 1/k < 1/N < min(b(1),b(2)) and so lie in (a(1),b(1)) 
and (a(2),b(2)) while its other coordinates are 0 so lie in (a(n),b(n)) 
trivially. <br>
Thus Z_k do converge to O in the box topology. <br>


<P>
#5: In (R^omega, uniform), closure(R^infty)={sequences which converge to 
zero.} <br>
Pf: Let X=(X(1),X(2),.....) with lim X(n) = 0. <br>
Let X_k=(X(1),X(2),..,X(k),0,0,....) then X_k in R^infty. <br>
Note p(X_k,X)=[sup for j > k]|X(j)|. <br>
Now for any E > 0, since lim X(n)=0, we have there is a N such that n > N 
gives |X(n)| < E/2. <br>
Thus p(X_k,X) <= E/2 for k > N. Thus B_p(X,E) intersects R^infty. <br>
Since E > 0 was arbitrary, this shows X is in closure(R^infty). <br>
On the other hand take Y=(Y(1),Y(2),....) where lim Y(n) not zero (also 
including case of no limit.) <br>
What this means is there is some E > 0, such that there are infinitely 
many values of index j such that |Y(j)| >= E. Let J be the set of 
these indices, so |J|=infinite. <br>
Now if Z in R^infty, then Z=(Z(1),Z(2),...,Z(N),0,0,......). <br>
Choose one of the indices in j in J with j > N (We know we can since 
|J|=infinite). Then |Y(j)-Z(j)|=|Y(j)| >= E and so p(Y,Z) >= E. <br>
Thus for every Z in R^infty, p(Y,Z) >= E > 0 (E fixed). Thus 
B_p(Y,E/2) does not intersect R^infty and so Y is not in closure(R^infty). 
<br> 

<P>
#6:(a): <br>
Consider Y=(x_1+E-E/1, x_2+E-E/2,...,x_n+E-E/n,.....) then 
Y in U(X,E) but p(X,Y)=sup(E-E/n)=E and so Y not in B_p(X,E) 
since things in B_p(X,E) have p-distance STRICTLY LESS than E from X. <br>
So this shows U(X,E) is not equal to B_p(X,E). <br>
(b): Consider the Y above in U(X,E). Let D > 0, then there is N such 
that E/N < D. <br>
Consider Y'=(x_1+E-E/1,x_2+E-E/2,....,x_(N-1)+E-E/(N-1),x_(N)+E,....)
notice that Y' is just Y where we just change the entry in the Nth 
coordinate from x_N+E-E/N to x_N+E. <br>
Thus p(Y,Y')=E/N < D so Y' in B_p(Y,D). <br> 
However since the Nth coordinate of Y' is x_(N)+E, it is not in U(X,E). 
<br>
Thus we see for all D > 0, B_p(Y,D) intersects the complement of U(X,E).
Since Y in U(X,E), this shows U(X,E) is not open in the uniform topology. 
<br>
(c): Let D < E < 1. <br>
Notice if Y in U(X,D) then for all n, 
X(n) - D < Y(n) < X(n) + D. <br>
Thus Sup(|X(n)-Y(n)|) <= D (note less than becomes less than or equal 
under sup). <br>
So p(X,Y) <= D < E and so U(X,D) subset B_p(X,E) <br>
Thus union(D < E) U(X,D) subset B_p(X,E). <br>
On the other hand if Y in B_p(X,E), then p(X,Y)=C < E. <br>
Take D such that C < D < E, then clearly Y in U(X,D) so 
Y in union(D < E) U(X,D). <br> 
So B_p(X,E) subset union(D < E) U(X,D) also. <br>
Since we also have the reverse inclusion, this shows the two sets are 
equal as desired. <br>

#3(a): Verify p is a metric. Set X=(x_1,...,x_n), Y=(y_1,..,y_n), 
Z=(z_1,...,z_n) <br>
d_i are metrics so d_i(x_i,y_i)=d_i(y_i,x_i) and so 
this gives p(X,Y)=p(Y,X). <br>
d_i(x_i,y_i) >= 0 give p(X,Y) >= 0. <br>
On the other hand p(X,Y)=0 if and only if d_i(x_i,y_i)=0 for 1 <= i <= n. 
<br>
This happens if and only if x_i=y_i for 1 <= i <= n (since d_i were 
metrics). <br>
Thus p(X,Y)=0 if and only if X=Y. <br>
Since the d_i were metrics we have: <br>
d_i(x_i,y_i) <= d_i(x_i,z_i) + d_i(z_i,y_i) for 1 <= i <= n. <br>
Clearly we can replace the RHS with the maximums and not effect the 
inequality and so we get: <br>
d_i(x_i,y_i) <= p(X,Z) + p(Z,Y) for 1 <= i <= n. <br>
Now p(X,Y)=d_k(x_k,y_k) for some k in {1,2,..,n}. <br>
Thus from the previous inequality, we get: <br>
p(X,Y) <= p(X,Z) + p(Z,Y) which is the triangle inequality. <br>
Thus p is a metric on the product space. <br>

Now we show the p-topology is the product topology. <br>

B_p(X,E)<br>
={Y | p(Y,X) < E} <br>
={(y_1,...,y_n) | max(d_i(x_i,y_i)) < E } <br>
={(y_1,...,y_n) | d_i(x_i,y_i) < E for all 1 <= i <= n. } <br>
= B_{d_1}(x_1,E) x B_{d_2}(x_2,E) x .... x B_{d_n}(x_n,E). <br>

Thus the p-topology basis is the product topology basis and so the 
p-topology is the product topology. <br>

<P>
#10: Define f: R^2 -> R by f(x,y)=xy and g: R^2 -> R by g(x,y)=x^2+y^2. 
<br>
From calculus, we know f and g are continuous. <br>
A=f^{-1}({1}) so since {1} is closed in R, A is closed in R^2. <br>
S^1=g^{-1}({1}) so since {1} is closed in R, S^1 is closed in R^2. <br>
B^2=g^{-1}([0,1]) so since [0,1] is closed in R, B^2 is closed in R^2.
