<B> Midterm  = 100 </B><BR>
<B> Final Exam = 200 </B><BR>
<B> Homework  = 180 </B><BR>
<B> Total points = 480 </B>
</CENTER>

<P>
There will be 10 homework sets worth 20 points each but your lowest 
one is dropped, thus total, the homework contributes 9 x 20 = 180 
points towards your total course points.  <br>
If the final exam percentage is higher than the midterm score, then it will replace the midterm score.

<B>Necessary Background</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
The prerequisites for this course are: <br>
(a) Knowledge of the basics of multivariable calculus as in MTH164 or
MTH174 or their equivalents is not strictly necessary but desirable as to 
appreciate topology, one has to have some familiarity with the 
``classical'' example of R^n.  <br>
(b) Some experience in making and understanding proofs. 
(A lot of this will be learnt during the course but some exposure 
in making simple proofs is definitely desirable.) <br>
(c) It is not necessary, but recommended that you have some 
exposure to linear algebra, especially to the concept of a vector space. 
It also would be nice if one has had exposure to an analysis course 
such as MTH265 but this is also not necessary.
<br> 
 
In general, mathematical maturity (i.e., exposure with  
making and understanding mathematical arguments) is definitely helpful. 
As with anything, this will get easier as things go along 
and one gets more familiarity with the concepts. 
	Devoloping this ability is important as it  
augments the learning of the practical techniques and develops the 
critical thinking needed to apply the material efficiently in other 
areas of study and work. This ability will form the basis in being 
able to learn higher analytical techniques both in theory and in 
practice. 

<P>
<CENTER>
<B>A Word on Attendence</B>
</CENTER>
Class attendence will not be mandatory. Of course, attendence is strongly 
recommended. It is assumed that everyone taking this course will exercise 
responsibility in keeping up with the material and workload of the course. 

<P>
<CENTER>
<B>A Word on Homework</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
You are expected to try all of the homework.  Be aware
that you might see very similar problems on the exams.
Learning math is like learning to play a musical instrument or a sport:
you can read books about it and watch other people do it
all day; but unless you practice over and over again,
you won't be able to do it to save your life. 

<P>
There will be assigned problems which will be computational 
- an application of the techniques - however a big chunk of 
the problems will be more conceptual and theoretical than you 
have probably had in previous math courses. This is because 
in this course, the focus is in understanding the fundamental theoretical 
ideas and underpinnings 
that will be used in many advanced applications such as Fourier/Harmonic 
analysis, functional analysis, differential topology/geometry. 
Thus our goal is to understand these fundamental theoretical concepts 
in this course. 

For the conceptual/theoretical 
problems, you will actually need to write <B> full
sentences </B> and even <B>paragraphs</B> to make your arguments and 
explain what you are doing.  Of
course, some equations
will probably appear in the middle, but fundamentally, theoretical
and proof problems are about making an argument using <B>words</B>.
As with anything, we will ease into these sorts of questions 
and they will get easier with practice.

<P>
You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work on problems and
problem sets together, in pairs or small groups.  Working together is
a good thing, especially on harder problems.

<P>
However, if you choose to collaborate, be aware of some ground rules.
First, working together does not mean that John does the first half
of the problem set and Jane does the second half; everyone should
work on every problem.  Second, if you do work together, say with
Pete and Kari, I require that you write a note on the front of your
homework saying, ``I worked with Pete and Kari.''  (Please
make sure your name stands out from Pete's and Kari's,
so I know that you are the author of that problem set.)  Third, each student
must write up each problem <B>in his or her own words</B>.  Working
together means discussing the problems.  Copying (even when the
source doesn't mind) is plagiarism and will be prosecuted as academic
dishonesty.

<P>
If you get stuck on homework, or you're feeling lost in abstraction or
whatever, please come talk to me.  That is the purpose of office
hours so don't feel shy.  

<P>
Remember that I consider reading the book to be part of the homework.
If you've at least skimmed the relevant section before a given
lecture, it'll make my lecture a whole lot clearer.  In fact, in an 
advanced math course, if you don't at least skim, it is probably hard 
to get much out of lecture. The ideal is to read the sections 
then attend lecture to help assimilate concepts and that reread the 
section after the lecture if possible. 
I think it's very
difficult to learn the material from either the book or the lectures
alone, so please use both.

<B>What is covered in this course?</B> 
</CENTER>

<P> Roughly speaking ``Topology'' is the branch of math dealing with 
the ``shape'' of objects. 

<P> It is usually divided into roughly 3 parts: General Topology (what 
this course is about), Algebraic Topology and Differential Topology. <BR>
Algebraic Topology uses algebraic techniques and deals with more 
combinatorial like objects such as polyhedra. <br>
Differential Topology uses differential techniques from calculus and deals 
with ``smooth'' objects such as spheres, doughnuts and other ``decent'' 
subsets of Euclidean space. <br>
General Topology is the foundation needed to study any of these branches 
or analysis - it tends to be a bit more formal but that is basically due 
to its foundational nature.

<P>
<B>Chapter 1:</B>

<P> Review of set theory, functions and some basic properties of 
functions. Study of relations. (2 main types: equivalence relations
and strict order relations.) Brief discussion of the concept of 
cardinality of a set, and the concepts of finiteness and countable versus 
uncountable. We will discuss briefly the principles of recursive 
definition and the axiom of choice and then look at the well-ordering 
principle. 

<P>
<B>Chapter 2:</B>

<P> We will discuss the concept of a topological space, and such ideas 
like the ``basis'' for a topology. 
We will then give examples of how you can 
get a topological space from (a) a set with a strict order, 
(b) being a subset of another topological space, (c) being a Cartesian 
product of two topological spaces and (d) having a metric.  <br>
We will also study the important quotient topology construction which lets 
us fold and glue spaces together to get new spaces. <br>
Along the way we will discuss some basic concepts that come up with a 
topological space: open sets, closed sets, limit points and continuous 
functions. <br>

<P>
<B>Chapter 3:</B>
The fundamental topological concept of ``connectedness'' will be studied. 
<br> Roughly speaking this is the property of being ``topologically in one 
piece''. <br>
We will classify the connected subsets of any ``linear continuum'' like the 
real line. <br>
We will use the invariance of connectedness under homeomorphism to 
distinguish spaces. <br>
The fundamental topological concept of ``compactness'' will then be 
studied. Roughly speaking this is the property of being ``topologically 
finite''. <br>

<P>

<B>What to Expect</B> 
</CENTER>

<P>
This class is reasonable but due to the nature of the material, will 
require some diligence. However, as 
long as you keep up with the lectures, do
the homework and figure out what you did wrong on any mistakes, then the 
exams should not be too much of a problem. 
(If you study for them!) 

<P>
If you ever need any ideas or help on anything, please 
don't be shy to come to my office hours. (that's what they're for!) 
However if you're nervous about coming to me, or if
my office hours are at an inconvenient time, or they're too crowded,
or you'd like to get a second opinion on something, please ask the 
course TA.

<P>
A final word, about classroom dynamics.  I want to emphasize that I
strongly encourage class participation.  Interrupt me, ask
questions, dive in head first.  The flip side is that when I'm asking
a question to the class, I'm usually expecting an answer.  If you have
an idea (not necessarily a fully formed answer; that's usually not
what I'm looking for), shout it out.  Please try not to worry about saying
something stupid; I
guarantee you that if you're confused about something, someone else
(and probably most of the class) is, too.
