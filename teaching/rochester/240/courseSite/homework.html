<h1>Homework Assignments for Math 240<br>
Spring 2013 </h1>
<hr>
<br>


<p> Homework assignments are due <b> Wednesday, and must be submitted in class. Late homework will not receive credit without a valid excuse emailed to me well in advance of the due date.  </b> </p>

<p>Homework can be picked up from Clayton Lungstrum's office, located at 818 Hylan. Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. </p>

        [General Suggestion: In general, it is helpful to ``skim read'' all the
        exercises in Munkres chapters as part of the reading. You can pick up
        info that helps reinforce various points in the reading and it helps
        ``expand ones mathematical horizons'' beyond the core material. Also
        try to visualize problems for example in Section 3 rather than just
        going through the formal proof of them since visualization is an
        important part of topology.] </td>

        [Though Sections 8 and 9 are not core for this course, do read some of
        the exercises for example #6,7,8 in section 9 for some general
        background on "set theoretic" issues.] </td>

        <b>Section 13: </b> 4(c)(a),7,8 <br>
        [For #4 in section 13, you should probably do (c) before (a) as
        suggested as this will help you understand what (a) is asking for.
        While doing #6 of section 10, it will be useful to keep in mind that
        S(Omega) is an uncountable set although for each x in S(Omega), S_x={ a
        &lt; x} is countable.] </td>

        [For #8, remember to consider the special case of vertical/horizontal
        lines carefully. For #10, "compare" means for each pair of topologies
        you should decide which one is finer/coarser or if they are
        incomparable.] </td>

      (Note: For #18 recall that the ordered square is obtained as follows:
      Take the unit square [0,1] x [0,1] and give it the dictionary ordering
      coming from the usual order of the factors. Then form the order
      topology from that. See example 3 of page 90 of the book for further

      <b>Section 21: </b>3(a),10 <br>
      (In section 21, #3(a), should not only show that "rho" is a metric for
      X(1) x ... x X(n) but that it induces the product topology where the
      usual metric topology is used for the individual factors X(j). Hint for
      section 20, #6(b): It is enough to see why U(O,0.5) is not open in the
      uniform topology. Here O is the zero sequence. Show that in the uniform
      topology, the sequence (a(1),a(2),a(3),....) where a(n)=0.5-1/(2n) is
      in U(O,0.5) but not in the interior of U(O,0.5). This will show
      U(O,0.5) is not open in the uniform topology.) </td>

      [For #2(a), note since p is continuous, to check it is a quotient map
      it remains to show (i) p is onto and (ii) p^{-1}(V) open in X -&gt; V
      open in Y. For #2(b), you might want to consider the inclusion map i: A
      -&gt; X such that i(a)=a.  <br>

      [For Section 24, #2, suppose not, then one can construct g: S^1 -&gt; R
      by g(x)=f(x)-f(-x) and h(x)=g(x)/|g(x)| is a continuous function with
      domain S^1. Show that h(-x)=-h(x) and that Image(h)={-1,+1}. Explain
      then why this yields a contradiction. For #3 consider s(x)=f(x)-x and
      begin by looking at s(0) and s(1).] </p>
