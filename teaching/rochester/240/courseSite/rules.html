<h1>Homework Rules for Math 240 <br>
Spring 2013 </h1>
</center>
<hr>
<br>


<p>1. Homework assignments are due <b> Wednesday, and must be submitted in class. Late homework will not receive credit without a valid excuse emailed to me well in advance of the due date.  </b> </p>

<p>2. Late homeworks will not be accepted for grades, except in extreme cases
such as religious conflicts or family emergencies. </p>

<p>3. Your name must be written on all sheets handed in. </p>

<p>4. Please staple or clip pages together. </p>

<p>5. You may collaborate on homework. However: </p>

<p></p>
<ul>
  A. You must write on your problem set the names of all people you
  collaborated with. Make sure your name stands out as the author of your
  homework, however. 

  <p>B. Each collaborator must hand in his or her own problem set. You cannot
  hand in a single set as the work of several people. </p>

  <p>C. When collaborating, every student must work on every problem. You may
  not divide the problems up between yourselves. </p>

  <p>D. Collaboration means discussing the problems together. However, the
  actual writing must be done individually; everyone should submit their
  answers in their own words. <b>Copying is NOT allowed, and it will be
  considered academic dishonesty.</b> </p>
</ul>

<p>6. Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. </p>
