<h3>Textbook</h3>
<strong>Numerical Analysis, 3rd Edition</strong>
by David Kincaid and Ward Cheney 

<h3>C Programming References and Setup</h3>
<strong><a href="./pdfs/C_book.pdf">The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition </a></strong>
by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie 
<br>
In my opinion, the best book on C. Chapters 1-5 are the most important for the course.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/562303/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list> C book guide </a></strong>
<br>
In general, http://stackoverflow.com will be a big help to you when programming.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a href=http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/c.php>C code editing tools </a>      </strong>
</strong>
<br>
The links on the page will help you set up the Eclipse C/C++ IDE (integrated development environment),
<br> one of the more
popular cross-platform IDEs. If you don't like Eclipse, there are numerous other IDEs available. <br>
I encourage you to do a google search and explore.


<h3>Course Description</h3>
We will discuss the numerical solution of differential equations, approximation, error analysis, numerical integration, and floating point arithmetic.  

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
MTH 162, and familiary with reading and writing proofs.


<a name="Policies"></a>
<center><h2>Course Policies</h2></center>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
Students are expected to abide by the University of Rochester Academic Honesty Policy, available at
<a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty"><tt>www.rochester.edu/college/honesty</tt></a>.
<br>Academic misconduct of any kind will result in the assignment of a failing
grade.

<h3> Class and Recitation Participation</h3>
I strongly encourage class participation. Interrupt me, ask questions, dive in head first. The flip side is that when I'm asking a question to the class, I'm usually expecting an answer. If you have an idea (not necessarily a fully formed answer; that's usually not what I'm looking for), shout it out. Please try not to worry about saying something silly; I guarantee you that if you're confused about something, someone else (and probably most of the class) is, too. 
<br>
Recitations will meet once a week. These will focus on problems related to material covered in lecture and found in the homework.

<h3>Homework</h3>
All homework assignments are due in class, at the start of class, and no late homework will be accepted under any circumstances (you will receive zero credit). Hence, you should always try to avoid working on homework at the last minute. Solutions will be posted on the due date, after the end of class.
<br>
<br>
There will be one programming exercise on each homework assignment. The solution source must be coded in C or C++, and emailed to qzhu10@z.rochester.edu by the start of class. If you are unfamiliar with either language, I recommend learning C---it is a small, fast, and elegant language, and essential for understanding how almost all other programming languages (including C++) are implemented. If you have experience with C++ and prefer using it instead, please feel free. 

<br> <br>Regarding grading of C and C++ source code, the rubric is as follows: if the code does not compile, you will receive no credit. If it compiles with errors, you will receive at most half credit. This is to encourage you to compile and debug your code. 

<br><br>You are expected to do all of the homework. Be aware that you might see slightly modified versions of the homework problems on the exams. Learning math is like learning to play a musical instrument or a sport: you can read books about it and watch other people (like me) do it all day; but unless you practice over and over again, you won't be able to do it to save your life.

<br><br>Some of the assigned problems will be computational. For those problems, it is important that you not simply write the answer; to get full credit, you need to show the work you did to execute the computation. The rest of the problems will be theoretical or conceptual. For those problems, you will actually need to write full sentences and even paragraphs to make your arguments. Of course, some equations will probably appear in the middle, but fundamentally, theoretical and proof problems are about making an argument using words. As with anything, we will ease into these sorts of questions slowly and they will get easier with practice.
<br>
<br>
You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work on problems and problem sets together, in pairs or small groups. Working together is a good thing, especially on harder problems.

However, if you choose to collaborate, be aware of some ground rules. First, working together does not mean that John does the first half of the problem set and Jane does the second half; everyone should work on every problem. Second, if you do work together, say with Pete and Kari, I require that you write a note on the front of your homework saying, ``I worked with Pete and Kari.'' (Please make sure your name stands out from Pete's and Kari's, so I know that you are the author of that problem set.) Third, each student must write up each problem in his or her own words. Working together means discussing the problems. Copying (even when the source doesn't mind) is plagiarism and will be prosecuted as academic dishonesty.

If you get stuck on homework, or you're feeling lost in abstraction or whatever, please come talk to me. That is the purpose of office hours so don't feel shy. Feel free to come together with Pete and Kari as a group.

Remember that I consider reading the book to be part of the homework. If you've at least skimmed the relevant section before a given lecture, it'll make my lecture a whole lot clearer. I think it's very difficult to learn the material from either the book or the lectures alone, so please use both.
<!--There will also be a few written homework assignments that will be announced in advance. No late homework will be accepted.-->
<!--<p/>-->
<!--In addition to graded homework, practice problems will be suggested from the textbook. These will not be graded, but similar problems may appear in recitations, quizzes, and exams.-->

<br>
There will be two in-class midterm exams and one final exam.
<br>
These will be closed-book, closed-notes tests. The use of electronic devices will not be permitted during the exams. No make-up exams are anticipated.
<br>


<h3>Note to Students with Disabilities</h3>
It is University of Rochester policy to provide reasonable accommodations to students who have a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, psychiatric, vision, hearing, or systemic) that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the College's Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning and their instructors for a confidential discussion of their individual need for academic accommodations. The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning is located in 107 Lattimore Hall. Staff can be reached by calling 585-275-9049 or through their website <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/cetl"> <tt>www.rochester.edu/college/cetl</tt></a>.
<br>
<br>
Please notify me of any need for accommodations as early as possible.

<h3>Extra Help</h3>
I will be available to answer any questions on a walk-in basis during my office hours. All questions regarding technical aspects of the course (solving certain ODEs, numerical simulations, etc) must be asked in person--email is a poor medium for discussing complicated mathematics. If you have other questions about the course that are non-technical in nature, of course please feel free to email. I may also be available by appointment. 

<br>
<br>
Math graduate students are available to answer questions on a walk-in basis in the Math Study Hall, which is open Monday through Friday 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM in the Math Lounge, Hylan 901.
