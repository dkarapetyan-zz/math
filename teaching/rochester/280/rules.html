</P>

<P>

cases such as religious conflicts or family emergencies.
</P>

<P>

<P>
5. Multiple pages must be stapled or clipped together.  No dog ears.
</P>

<P>
6. You may collaborate on homework.  However:
</P>
<P> <UL> A. You must write on your problem set the names of all people
            you collaborated with.  Make sure your name stands out as
	    the author of your homework, however.
</P>
<P>      B. Each collaborator must hand in his or her own problem set.
            You cannot hand in a single set as the work of several people.
</P>
<P>      C. When collaborating, every student must work on every problem.
            You may not divide the problems up between yourselves.

<P>      D. Collaboration means discussing the problems together.  However,
            the actual writing must be done individually; everyone should
            submit their answers in their own words.

            dishonesty.</B>
