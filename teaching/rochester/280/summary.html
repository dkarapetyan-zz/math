<P>
There will be 12 homework sets worth 20 points each but your lowest 
two are dropped, thus total, the homework contributes 10 x 20 = 200 
points towards your total course points. You also must do at least 
70 homework problems reasonably well during the semester or else you
automatically fail the course.

<P>
<CENTER>
<B>Necessary Background</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Officially, the prerequisites are the full two year calculus sequence
including exposure to differential equations and linear algebra. No programming
experience is necessary though a few parts of the book and lectures
will describe some algorithms using "pseudocode" - this will be developed
as the semester progresses so no former background is neccessary though it can be useful.
We will also require the mathematical maturity that comes from such a sequence
and some exposure to formal arguments as would be learnt in Math 200 or 235 -
basically some definitions and concepts will require some careful thought
to digest.

<P>
<CENTER>
<B>A Word on Homework</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
You are expected to do all of the homework.  If the grade drop for
blowing it off or the automatic fail for not doing at least 70 problems
isn't enough to motivate you, be aware
that you might see very similar problems on the tests.
Learning math is like learning to play a musical instrument or a sport:
you can read books about it and watch other people (like me) do it
all day; but unless you practice over and over again,
you won't be able to do it to save your life.

<P>
Some of the assigned problems will be computational.
For those problems, it is important that you not simply write the
answer; to get full credit, you need to show the work you did to
execute the computation.  The rest of the problems will be theoretical 
or conceptual.
For those problems, you will actually need to write <B> full
sentences </B> and even <B>paragraphs</B> to make your arguments.  Of
course, some equations
will probably appear in the middle, but fundamentally, theoretical
and proof problems are about making an argument using <B>words</B>.
As with anything, we will ease into these sorts of questions slowly 
and they will get easier with practice.

<P>
You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work on problems and
problem sets together, in pairs or small groups.  Working together is
a good thing, especially on harder problems.

<P>
However, if you choose to collaborate, be aware of some ground rules.
First, working together does not mean that John does the first half
of the problem set and Jane does the second half; everyone should
work on every problem.  Second, if you do work together, say with
Pete and Kari, I require that you write a note on the front of your
homework saying, ``I worked with Pete and Kari.''  (Please
make sure your name stands out from Pete's and Kari's,
so I know that you are the author of that problem set.)  Third, each student
must write up each problem <B>in his or her own words</B>.  Working
together means discussing the problems.  Copying (even when the
source doesn't mind) is plagiarism and will be prosecuted as academic
dishonesty.

<P>
If you get stuck on homework, or you're feeling lost in abstraction or
whatever, please come talk to me.  That is the purpose of office
hours so don't feel shy.  Feel free to
come together with Pete and Kari as a group.

<P>
Remember that I consider reading the book to be part of the homework.
If you've at least skimmed the relevant section before a given
lecture, it'll make my lecture a whole lot clearer.  I think it's very
difficult to learn the material from either the book or the lectures
alone, so please use both.

<P>
<CENTER>
<B>What to Expect</B> 
</CENTER>

<P>
This is a reasonable class. As long as you keep up with the lectures, do
the homework and figure out what you did wrong on any mistakes, then the 
exams should not be too much of a problem. 
(If you study for them!) 

<P>
If you ever need any ideas or help on anything, please 
don't be shy to come to my office hours. (that's what they're for!) 
However if you're nervous about coming to me, or if
my office hours are at an inconvenient time, or they're too crowded,
or you'd like to get a second opinion on something, you can also
drop in and see the course TA 

<P>
A final word, about classroom dynamics.  I want to emphasize that I
strongly encourage class participation.  Interrupt me, ask
questions, dive in head first.  The flip side is that when I'm asking
a question to the class, I'm usually expecting an answer.  If you have
an idea (not necessarily a fully formed answer; that's usually not
what I'm looking for), shout it out.  Please try not to worry about saying
something stupid; I
guarantee you that if you're confused about something, someone else
(and probably most of the class) is, too.
