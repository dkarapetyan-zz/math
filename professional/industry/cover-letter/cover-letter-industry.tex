\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:\\}
%
%
I wish to apply for positions in quantitative risk strategy at Credit Suisse. I am currently researching \textbf{partial differential equations}, and in particular nonlinear evolution equations as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics on May, 2012 from the University of Notre Dame. My
background in mathematics, and in particular my experience
\textbf{programming} numerical algorithms in \textbf{C++} and \textbf{MATLAB}
to aid my research, have given me the tools needed to build a career at Credit Suisse.

In addition to my work at the University of Rocheser and at Notre Dame, I have also worked in Washington D.C. as a research
associate for both the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Battelle Memorial
Institute. My numerical and consulting experience at these two think tanks are
detailed in my resume. 

I am passionate about quantitative analysis in the financial sector due to its reliance on high level mathematics and programming to model macroeconomic phenomena. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. It would be a
pleasure to interview with you, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for
your time and consideration. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
