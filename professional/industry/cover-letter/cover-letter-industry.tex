\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:\\}
%
%
I wish to apply for a position as a quantitative analyst at GFT Markets. I am currently researching \textbf{partial differential equations}, and in particular nonlinear evolution equations as a \textbf{Visiting Assistant Professor} at the University of Rochester. I received my \textbf{Ph.D. in mathematics} on May, 2012 from the University of Notre Dame. My
background in mathematics, and in particular my experience
\textbf{programming} numerical algorithms in \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Ruby}, and \textbf{MATLAB}
to aid my research, have given me the tools needed to build a career at your firm.

In addition to my work at the University of Rochester and the University of Notre Dame, I have also worked in Washington D.C. as a research
associate for both the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Battelle Memorial
Institute. My numerical and consulting experience at these two think tanks are
detailed in my resume. 

I am passionate about quantitative analysis and development in the financial
sector due to its reliance on high level mathematics and programming to model
macroeconomic phenomena. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to
ask. It would be a pleasure to interview with you, and I hope to hear from you
soon. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
