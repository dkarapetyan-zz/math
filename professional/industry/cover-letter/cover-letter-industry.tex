\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:\\}
%

%
I wish to apply for a position as a quantitative analyst at D.E. Shaw. I am currently researching partial differential equations, and in particular nonlinear
evolution equations as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of
Rochester. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics on May, 2012 from the University
of Notre Dame. While the academic world is wonderful, I miss the fast pace of
industry, in particular the frenetic energy behind work dealing with the
financial markets. However, I also love mathematics, and dearly want to obtain
a position which relies heavily on it. Consequently, I feel work as a
quantitative analyst at an established hedge fund would be a great fit for me, as it would combine both preferences. However, I would overwhlemingly prefer to work at D.E. Shaw instead of any other hedge fund, since excellent word of mouth amongst professional mathematicians and online data and testimonials have convinced me it
is the best hedge fund around, both in terms of benefits and mathematically challenging work. I feel I could contribute immediately to the
firm if hired, not only because of my background in mathematics, but also
because of my years of experience programming numerical algorithms in C++,
Ruby, and MATLAB to aid my research. I have applied before to D.E. Shaw, several times, and am willing to apply for as many times as needed. I ask only for a chance to prove to the firm that I belong and can deliver excellent work.

In addition to jobs held at the University of Rochester and at Notre Dame, I have
also worked in Washington D.C. as a research associate for both the Institute
for Defense Analyses and the Battelle Memorial Institute. My numerical and
consulting experience at these two think tanks are detailed in my resume. 

I am passionate about quantitative analysis due to its reliance on mathematics and programming to model everything from credit risk to option price movements. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. It would be a
pleasure to interview with you, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for
your time and consideration. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
