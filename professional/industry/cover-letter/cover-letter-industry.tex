Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:

I wish to apply for a position as a quantitative analyst. I am currently
researching partial differential equations, and in particular nonlinear
evolution equations as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of
Rochester. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics on May, 2012 from the University
of Notre Dame. While the academic world is wonderful, I miss the fast pace of
industry, in particular the frenetic energy behind work dealing with the
financial markets. However, I also love mathematics, and dearly want to obtain
a position which relies heavily on it. Consequently, I feel work as a
quantitative analyst at your firm would be a perfect fit for me, as it would
combine both preferences. I also feel I could contribute immediately to the
firm upon hiring, not only because of my background in mathematics, but also
because of my years of experience programming numerical algorithms in C++,
Ruby, and MATLAB to aid my research. 

In addition to my work at the University of Rochester and the University of
Notre Dame, I have also worked in the Washington D.C. metro area as a research
associate for both the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Battelle Memorial
Institute. My numerical and consulting experience at these two think tanks are
detailed in my resume. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. It would be a
pleasure to interview with you, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for
your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

David Karapetyan
