I am currently working in PDEs and in particular nonlinear evolution equations
as a student of Alex Himonas at the University of Notre Dame. I have been
studying the hyperelastic rod (HR) equation, an important nonlinear evolution
equation modeling finite-length and small-amplitude axial deformation waves in
thin cylindrical rods. I recently published a paper on this equation, entitled
\textit{``Non-uniform dependence and well-posedness for the hyperelastic rod
equation''}. I have also recently completed a preprint entitled
\textit{``H\"older continuity of the data to solution map for HR in the weak
topology''}. For more information on past and current projects, please consult
my \href{http://davidkarapetyan.com/pdfs/cv.pdf}{vita} and

	Conducted research for Army sponsored and privately sponsored projects 
	in the field of Biowarfare. Researched the Analytic Hierarchy Process 
	(AHP) and used it to devise an algorithm that ranked biochemicals by 
	overall tactical effectiveness.

	Conducted research for Pentagon sponsored and privately sponsored 
	projects. Initiated contact with Fluor Corporation senior engineers and 
	managers. Developed presentations by compiling and analyzing data on 
	existing HOT lanes in the Los Angeles, San Diego, and Chicago metro 
	areas.  Actions led to Fluor Corporation's decision to spearhead 
	construction of DC metro area HOT lanes in 2008, a \$500 million dollar 
	venture.
