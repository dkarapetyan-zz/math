\opening{Dear Members of the Hiring Committee:\\}
%
%
I wish to apply for a night assistant trader position at Breakwater Trading. I am
currently working in \textbf{partial differential equations} and in particular
\textbf{nonlinear evolution equations} at the University of Notre Dame, and 
anticipate completing my Ph.D. in May, 2012. My
background in applied mathematics, and in particular my experience coding
numerical algorithms in C++ and MATLAB to aid my research, have given me the
tools needed to build a career in finance.

Prior to enrolling at Notre Dame, I worked in Washington D.C. as a research
associate for both the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Battelle Memorial
Institute. My numerical and consulting experience at these two think tanks are
detailed in my resume, and prepared me for work at Notre Dame and beyond. 

I am passionate about the trading profession because of its blistering pace, and heavy use of mathematics and programming. 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. It would be a
pleasure to interview with you, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for
your time and consideration. 

\closing{Sincerely,}


\end{letter}
