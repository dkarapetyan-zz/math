{\em On the Cauchy problem for a KdV-type equation on the
circle}, dissertation in preparation.\\
{\em Advisor}:  Professor Alex Himonas\\ 
{\em Abstract}:  Here we consider the periodic
Cauchy problem for a modified
Camassa-Holm (mCH)
equation and prove local existence and uniqueness for initial data in the
Sobolev space
$H^s(\mathbb{T}), s \ge 1/2$.  
Concerning analyticity, we show that the mCH Cauchy problem with analytic
initial data is analytic in the space variable.  Finally, we explore the
limiting behavior of the mCH equation through numerical experimentation.

{\em Abstract}:  We study the periodic Cauchy problem for

Bourgain
spaces for initial data in the Sobolev space
$H^s(\mathbb{T}), s \ge 1/2$.  We show that the corresponding bilinear
estimates fail when $s<1/2$, which indicates that $s=1/2$ may be the
critical Sobolev exponent for well-posedness.      }

{\em The Cauchy problem for a modified Camassa-Holm equation with analytic
initial data}, preprint.\\  {\em Abstract}:  We show that the periodic Cauchy problem for a modified Camassa-Holm
equation with analytic initial data is analytic in the space variable $x$ for
all time. By differentiating the equation and the initial condition with
respect to $x$ we obtain a sequence of initial value problems of KdV-type
equations. These, written in the form of integral equations, define
a mapping on a Banach  space whose elements are sequences of analytic
functions equipped with a norm  expressing the Cauchy estimates
in terms of the KdV norms of the components introduced in the works
of Bourgain, Kenig, Ponce, Vega and others. By proving appropriate
bilinear estimates we show that this mapping is a contraction and
therefore we obtain a solution whose derivatives in the space variable
satisfy the Cauchy estimates.    }
